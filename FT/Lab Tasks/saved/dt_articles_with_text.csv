           Plantar warts are a common and often stubborn foot condition that can be uncomfortable and frustrating. These small, rough growths typically develop on the soles of the feet and may be painful when walking or standing. While plantar warts are not dangerous, they can be persistent and difficult to treat. Fortunately, there are several effective treatment options, ranging from over-the-counter remedies to professional medical procedures. Plantar warts are noncancerous skin growths that develop on the bottom of the foot. They are caused by certain strains of the human papillomavirus (HPV), which infects the outer layer of the skin. These warts are often found on weight-bearing areas like the heels and balls of the feet, where pressure can cause them to grow inward, forming a thick, callus-like surface. Unlike other types of warts that may appear smooth, plantar warts often have a rough texture and tiny black dots. They can vary in size and some people may have just one, while others develop clusters known as mosaic warts. Plantar warts develop when the HPV virus enters the skin through tiny cuts or breaks. This virus thrives in warm, moist environments, making places like locker rooms, swimming pools, and communal showers common sources of infection. Warts can develop at any age, but they become more frequent in school-age kids, with the highest occurrence between ages 12 and 16. Anyone can get plantar warts, but certain factors increase the risk, including: Because HPV spreads through direct or indirect contact, sharing towels, socks, or shoes with an infected person may also increase the risk of developing plantar warts. Plantar warts can sometimes be mistaken for corns or calluses, but there are a few key features that set them apart. Many plantar warts go away on their own. ""Plantar warts may go away on their own in the first two years, but after that they may persist,"" says Dr. Rebecca Gaffney, a dermatologist and instructor in dermatology at Harvard Medical School. In adults, natural resolution can take several years or more. If the wart is painful or uncomfortable, or is spreading to other areas of your body or to others, it might be a good idea to consider treatment. Options range from home remedies to medical interventions. Common at-home treatments include: If at-home treatments don't work, see a determatologist, who may recommend: Plantar warts can be stubborn, and it may take multiple treatments over the course of a few weeks or months to eliminate them. It's common for plantar warts to return, even after treatment. Take preventive steps to help reduce your risk.

           Health-conscious folks have long sprinkled savory nutritional yeast flakes — a vegan version of parmesan cheese — on popcorn, pasta, salad, and more for an umami-rich punch. But consumers should be aware that this condiment, affectionately known as ""nooch,"" sometimes functions like a supplement. Nutritional yeast is an inactivated strain of the fungus Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Some strains of this fungus cause bread to rise (baker's yeast) while others turn sugars into alcohol to brew beer (brewer's yeast). Nutritional yeast, however, can't do either: Processors grow the cells in energy-rich molasses, then de-activate them with heat. The yeast cells die, and release glutamic acid, a savory flavor. The USDA considers nutritional yeast a food additive. As a product, it comes in pouches or canisters, as flakes, granules, or a powder. Stores often sell it in the spice or condiment sections. (Don't confuse nutritional yeast with yeast supplements, which are capsules typically containing baker's and brewer's yeast.) Unfortified nutritional yeast contains just a few nutrients: One serving (two tablespoons) has 2% of the Daily Value (DV) for potassium and 8% DV for thiamin, as well as 180% DV riboflavin. ""Natural, unfortified nutritional yeast is not actually a great source of B vitamins,"" says Nancy Oliveira, a registered dietitian and manager of the nutrition and wellness service at Brigham and Women's Hospital. That said, most nutritional yeast found in grocery stores is fortified. Fortified nutritional yeast can contain very high levels of many vitamins including niacin, vitamin B6, thiamin, riboflavin, folate, and vitamin B12. Processors have to add many of these vitamins to their products because they're either not naturally present or not present at high levels. One serving of one popular brand of nutritional yeast also has 2 grams of fiber and 5 grams of protein. Since fortified nutritional yeast contains so many added vitamins, an independent third-party group called Consumer Lab, which analyzes supplements, tested several brands of nutritional yeast. They found that the nutrient levels listed on the labels weren't always accurate. There are a few reasons to be cautious when incorporating nutritional yeast into your diet. One is that the high levels of vitamins added to the products can quickly push you over the recommended daily level, and even past the upper limit. For example, the tolerable upper limit (UL) for niacin is 35 milligrams per day for adults. Some brands of nutritional yeast contain that amount, or much more, in a 2-tablespoon serving. High niacin intake can trigger niacin flushing, when the skin on the face, chest, and arms turns red and burns, itches, and tingles; headaches, rashes, and dizziness can also result. If you take a multivitamin in addition to eating nutritional yeast, you could be consuming even higher amounts of many vitamins. Other concerns exist as well. Though rare, some people are allergic or sensitive to Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Some people with inflammatory bowel diseases like Crohn's disease may experience issues after consuming nutritional yeast. Nutritional yeast also naturally contains the amino acid glutamate, which is a component of MSG. Anyone with a sensitivity to MSG may want to avoid it. If you are taking an older class of antidepressants called MAOIs, be aware that yeast naturally contains an amino acid called tyramine. In concentrated yeast products, tyramine levels are very high and can interact with MAOIs, causing a sharp spike in blood pressure and severe headache. Speak with your doctor before consuming nutritional yeast if you are taking an MAOI. Finally, vegans, who are at increased risk for vitamin B12 deficiency, sometimes consume fortified nutritional yeast to increase their vitamin B12 levels. (Unfortified nutritional yeast has no vitamin B12.) For many of these reasons, says Oliveira, ""I wouldn't eat nutritional yeast to get B12 up, as products contain such variable levels. I would take a B12 supplement or follow your doctor's guidance to treat an actual deficiency."" Oliveira says that if you like the taste of nutritional yeast and don't use too much of it, you should feel free to sprinkle it on your food. A dash on pasta or salad provides a little pop of umami flavor. Nutritional yeast can also help thicken soup or be used to flavor sour cream for a dip. Adding it to pesto in the place of parmesan cheese keeps it vegan as well. ""It is meant to be a condiment,"" says Oliveira, ""Not taken as a supplement or eaten in excess.""

           Pop quiz: what is Salmonella? If you've ever had a run-in with this bacteria, you know it can cause a food-borne illness called salmonellosis, a form of food poisoning. But you may not know that Salmonella bacteria sicken an estimated 1.35 million people every year in the United States. What's more, it's the leading cause of hospitalizations and deaths due to food poisoning. And Salmonella bacteria can be sneaky — not only by triggering unusual complications, but infecting people in startling ways, says Dr. Elizabeth Hohmann, an infectious disease specialist at Massachusetts General Hospital. One patient she treated showed up with an abdominal aortic aneurysm — a dangerous bulge in the lower section of the body's largest artery — that looked infected. Testing revealed a culprit some would find surprising: Salmonella. ""It's just an interesting organism and it can be kind of scary,"" she says. Many of the foods Salmonella bacteria lurk in are raw or undercooked. Breaded raw chicken products like nuggets and chicken Kiev are one way it may reach your table. But a variety of foods have been implicated — including organic basil, cantaloupes, ground beef, nut butters, raw cookie dough, eggs, raw or unpasteurized milk, and flour. Backyard poultry are another source of Salmonella outbreaks. Even small pets such as turtles and frogs, along with dog food, have contributed to multistate outbreaks in recent years. You can also become infected by handling contaminated food and spreading the bacteria from your hands to your mouth. Additionally, you can spread it to others on your hands or even on your clothes without becoming sick yourself. ""It's a bug that's carried in stool and animal feces and is also present in the environment,"" Dr. Hohmann says. ""So it can set up shop in lots of different inanimate objects, soils, and machinery, especially in moist environments."" Most of the time Salmonella infection leads to gastroenteritis, usually causing just an upset stomach, abdominal cramps, and diarrhea. These symptoms can start as soon as six hours after ingesting the bacteria. Typically, symptoms resolve on their own within two to three days. Some people have such mild symptoms they're barely noticeable. ""The classic case might be a college student who eats a burrito from a sketchy place, gets sick for a couple of days, gets better, and doesn't think anything of it,"" says Dr. Hohmann. Sometimes symptoms are more serious, such as severe abdominal cramping and bloody diarrhea, or unexplained high fever and marked fatigue. These symptoms require a call to your doctor. Most people will get better on their own without any medicines. Replacing lost fluids by sipping water or electrolyte drinks to avoid dehydration will help. Call a doctor if you have Treating the infection with medicine comes with an annoying paradox, Dr. Hohmann says. If doctors decide to prescribe antibiotics, the person taking the medicine may shed the organism for longer than if they were never treated. ""Then that person may have the opportunity — either through poor personal hygiene, sex, or working as a food worker — to spread it to others,"" she explains. ""It's challenging."" Some people get sicker with salmonellosis than others, with seemingly no rhyme or reason. But certain folks are especially vulnerable to serious infection, including: A small percentage of those infected can have Salmonella in their blood, which can spread the infection to other parts of the body such as the urinary tract, bones, joints, or central nervous system (brain and spinal fluid). And, like Dr. Hohmann's patient with the abdominal aortic aneurysm, on rare occasions Salmonella can lead to unusual blood vessel complications in people who already have atherosclerosis, blockage of the arteries caused by plaque buildup. We all can take steps to avoid the food poisoning, illness, and hospitalizations that Salmonella exposure can cause. Dr. Hohmann and the CDC suggest these strategies: Take additional steps to help more vulnerable people stay healthy: ""You hate to make people paranoid, so that we're washing our lettuce leaves with soap, but it's worth thinking about these things, particularly if you have people in your household who are susceptible — which is an increasing number of people,"" Dr. Hohmann says.

           Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastating disease. Despite decades of research, science has not pinned down causes or discovered highly effective treatments. And while a healthy diet, regular exercise, and other measures can help people slow or avoid AD, we badly need more routes for preventing it. That's why a new study is so intriguing — and potentially game-changing. Researchers have found that the risk of death due to AD is markedly lower in taxi and ambulance drivers compared with hundreds of other occupations. And the reason could be that these drivers develop structural changes in their brains as they work. In the past two decades, small studies demonstrated that London taxi drivers tend to have an enlargement in one area of the hippocampus, a part of the brain involved with developing spatial memory. Interestingly, that part of the brain is one area that's commonly damaged by AD. These observations led to speculation that taxi drivers might be less prone to AD than people with jobs that don't require similar navigation and spatial processing skills. A recent study explores this possibility by analyzing data from nearly nine million people who died over a three-year period and had occupation information on their death certificates. After accounting for age of death, researchers tallied Alzheimer's-related death rates for more than 443 different jobs. The results were dramatic. One possible explanation is that jobs requiring frequent real-time spatial and navigational skills change both structure and function in the hippocampus. If these jobs help keep the hippocampus healthy, that could explain why AD-related deaths — but not deaths due to other types of dementia — are lower in taxi and ambulance drivers. It could also explain the older studies that found enlargement in parts of the hippocampus in people with these jobs. And why aren't bus drivers, pilots, and ship captains similarly protected? The study authors suggest these other jobs involve predetermined routes with less real-time navigational demands. Thus, they may not change the hippocampus as much. A single research study is rarely definitive, especially an observational study like this one. Observational studies can only identify a relationship — not establish a firm cause — between a protective factor and a condition like AD. There could be other explanations for the findings. For example: And even if driving a taxi or ambulance could lower your risk of AD-related death, what's the impact of GPS technology now in widespread use? If these jobs now require less navigational demand due to GPS, will the protective effect of these jobs evaporate? You might wonder if these findings can be applied to anyone who wants to lower their risk of AD. For example, could outdoor treasure-hunting activities that require complex navigational skills, such as orienteering and geocaching, help stave off AD? At least one small study found that orienteering experts had better spatial memory than orienteering novices. Could puzzles, video games, or even board games designed to build spatial skills reduce the risk of AD? Think Rubik's Cubes and jigsaw puzzles, Minecraft and Tetris, chess and Labyrinth. A round of Battleship, anyone? And if these activities are actually helpful, how often would you need to play? I look forward to the results of studies exploring these questions. Until then, it's best to rely on experts' recommendations to reduce your risk of AD, including high-quality sleep, diet, and regular exercise. I find this new research about taxi and ambulance drivers having lower rates of AD-related death fascinating. Considering how often we hear about the risks of certain jobs, it's encouraging to hear about occupations that might actually protect you from disease. If confirmed by other research, the results of this study could lead to a better understanding of Alzheimer's disease — and, more importantly, how to prevent it.

           Mastitis is a painful infection of the breast that affects up to 30% of breastfeeding women. The infection can cause pain, swelling, and sometimes fever, making breastfeeding a challenging experience. Mastitis can also occur in women who aren't nursing. Understanding the causes, symptoms, and ways to prevent mastitis can help women navigate this difficult, but treatable, challenge. Mastitis can occur if milk hasn't properly drained from the breast during breastfeeding. Some factors that can lead to improper draining of milk include: As milk pools in the breast, milk ducts (thin tubes that carry milk from the breast to the nipples) can become blocked, creating an ideal environment for bacteria to grow and cause infection. (Bacteria can enter the breast through small cracks in the nipple or through the milk ducts.) Bacterial infections that result from these conditions can cause breast tissue to become inflamed. This is called lactational mastitis. Lactational mastitis is the most common form of mastitis. But less common types of mastitis can occur in women who are not breastfeeding. Periductal mastitis is a benign condition that causes inflammation of breast tissue surrounding milk ducts behind the nipple. The cause of periductal mastitis is not clear. Mastitis symptoms can come on very suddenly. Lactational mastitis is most likely to occur during the first three weeks after giving birth. Symptoms can occur in one breast or both breasts and may include: Several home remedies and measures can help to relieve symptoms of lactational mastitis. One of the most important things you can do is to frequently and fully empty the affected breast or breasts. Unless you do this, milk will continue to build up and infection may worsen. To help empty the breast(s), you should try breastfeeding more often. Starting on the sore breast can help. To help with pain and ease the flow of milk, you can apply heat like a warm compress, or take a warm shower before nursing. You can also try massaging the painful area toward the nipple during feeding or pumping to help relieve symptoms. After feeding, you can hand express or use a pump to fully drain the milk. Using a cold compress after breastfeeding may help reduce pain and swelling. Keep in mind that rest, hydration, and proper nutrition are key to recovery. Ask your doctor before taking nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs like ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) to help relieve pain while you are breastfeeding. Wearing a supportive but nonrestrictive bra is also important for comfort and healing. During the first 12 to 24 hours, conservative care like rest, heat, cold, and continued breastfeeding can help significantly in relieving symptoms of lactational mastitis. If symptoms don't improve within 24 hours, contact your doctor, who may prescribe antibiotics. Your doctor can advise you on how best to manage your pain. This is important because pain can interfere with milk flow. Ibuprofen is often preferred over acetaminophen (Tylenol) because it reduces both pain and inflammation. Up to 1,600 milligrams (mg) per day of ibuprofen is considered safe during breastfeeding, but talk to your doctor about your individual circumstances. Most people with lactational mastitis recover with proper treatment. Up to a third of women may experience a recurrent bout of mastitis. Periductal mastitis is usually treated with antibiotics. Here are some tips to help prevent mastitis while breastfeeding:

           An F may mean failure in school, but the letter earns high marks in your diet. The two biggest dietary Fs — fiber and fermented foods — are top priorities to help maintain healthy digestion, and they potentially offer much more. How can you fit these nutrients into meals? Can this help your overall health as well as gut health? The gut microbiome is a composed of bacteria, viruses, fungi, and other microorganisms living in the colon (large intestine). What you eat, the air you breathe, where you live, and many other factors affect the makeup of the gut microbiome. Some experts think of it as a hidden organ because it has a role in many important functions of the body — for example, helping the immune system function optimally, reducing chronic inflammation, keeping intestinal cells healthy, and providing some essential micronutrients that may not be included in a regular diet. Your gut communicates with your brain through pathways in the gut-brain axis. Changes in the gut microbiome have been linked with mood and mental health disorders, such as depression and anxiety. However, it's not yet clear that these changes directly cause these types of problems. We do know that a healthy diet low in processed foods is key to a healthy gut microbiome. And increasing evidence suggests that fiber and fermented foods can play important parts here. Fiber's main job is to make digestion smoother by softening and adding bulk to stool, making it pass quickly through the intestines. But fiber has other benefits for your microbiome and overall health. A high-fiber diet helps keep body weight under control and lowers LDL (bad) cholesterol levels. Research has found that eating enough fiber reduces the risk of heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and some cancers. There are two types of fiber: insoluble (which helps you feel full and encourages regular bowel movements) and soluble (which helps lower cholesterol and blood sugar). However, recent research suggests people should focus on the total amount of fiber in their diet, rather than type of fiber. If you're trying to add more foods with fiber to your diet, make sure you ease into new fiber-rich habits and drink plenty of water. Your digestive system must adapt slowly to avoid gas, bloating, diarrhea, and stomach cramps caused by eating too much too soon. Your body will gradually adjust to increasing fiber after a week or so. The fiber formula is 14 grams for every 1,000 calories consumed. Your specific calorie intake can vary depending on your activity levels. ""But instead of tracking daily fiber, focus on adding more servings of fiber-rich foods to your diet,"" says Eric Rimm, professor of epidemiology and nutrition at Harvard's T.H. Chan School of Public Health. Fruits, vegetables, legumes, nuts, seeds, and whole grains are all high in fiber. The Dietary Guidelines for Americans has a comprehensive list of fiber-rich foods and their calorie counts. What about over-the-counter fiber supplements that come in capsules, powders that you mix with water, and chewable tablets? ""If you have trouble eating enough fiber-rich foods, then these occasionally can be used, and there is no evidence they are harmful,"" says Rimm. ""But they should not serve as your primary source of dietary fiber."" Fermented foods contain both prebiotics — ingredients that create healthy changes in the microbiome — and beneficial live bacteria called probiotics. Both prebiotics and probiotics help maintain a healthy gut microbiome. Besides helping with digestion and absorbing vital nutrients from food, a healthy gut supports your immune system to help fight infections and protect against inflammation. Some research suggests that certain probiotics help relieve symptoms of gut-related conditions like inflammatory bowel disease and irritable bowel syndrome, though not all experts agree with this. Many foods that are fermented undergo lacto-fermentation, in which natural bacteria feed on the sugar and starch in the food, creating lactic acid. Not only does this process remove simple sugars, it creates various species of good bacteria, such as Lactobacillus or Bifidobacterium. (Keep in mind that some foods undergo steps that remove probiotics and other healthful microbes, as with beer or wine, or make them inactive, like baking and canning.) The exact amounts and specific strains of bacteria in fermented foods vary depending on how they are made. In addition to probiotics, fermented foods may contain other valuable nutrients like enzymes, B vitamins, and omega-3 fatty acids. There is no recommended daily allowance for prebiotics or probiotics, so it is impossible to know precisely which fermented foods or quantities are best. The general guideline is to add more to your daily diet. Fermented foods have a range of tastes and textures because of the particular bacteria they produce during fermentation or that are added to foods. Yogurt is one of the most popular fermented foods (look for the words ""live and active cultures"" on the label). Still, many options are available if you are not a yogurt fan or want to expand your fermented choices. Kimchi, sauerkraut, kombucha, and pickles are a few examples. As with fiber, probiotics are also marketed as over-the-counter supplements. However, like all dietary supplements, they do not require FDA approval, so there is no guarantee that the types of bacteria listed on a label can provide the promised benefits — or are even in the bottle. ""Therefore, it is best to get your probiotics from fermented foods,"" says Rimm.

           Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are a common health concern, particularly among postmenopausal women. Hormonal changes and other age-related factors can make older women more susceptible to these infections, which can be uncomfortable and sometimes serious if left untreated. Understanding why this happens, and how to prevent and manage UTIs, can help improve quality of life and reduce the risk of complications. Postmenopausal women are at higher risk for UTIs due to changes in their bodies after menopause. The drop in estrogen levels can lead to thinning of the vaginal and urethral tissues, which makes it easier for bacteria to enter the urinary tract. Additionally, estrogen helps maintain a healthy balance of bacteria in the vaginal area; a reduction in this hormone can disrupt this balance, increasing the risk of infection. Bladder changes can also increase risk. In some older women, the bladder may not empty completely, or they may experience urinary incontinence, allowing bacteria to multiply. Women who undergo medical procedures may also be at increased risk if catheters or other devices that can introduce bacteria into the urinary tract are used. UTIs often cause noticeable symptoms, but they can sometimes be subtle in older women. Common UTI symptoms include: UTI symptoms can sometimes be subtle and harder to identify in older women. Older women are more likely to experience less typical symptoms, such as: Preventing UTIs is particularly important for older women, who are more vulnerable to recurring infections. The first step in UTI prevention is to practice good hygiene. Wiping from front to back after using the toilet can prevent bacteria from spreading to the urethra. If you have a loss of bladder control, ensure you're regularly changing your protective underwear and keeping these areas clean and dry. In addition, staying hydrated helps flush bacteria from the urinary tract. Aim to drink at least four to six cups of water a day. Avoid holding urine for long periods, which can allow bacteria to grow. Diabetes is an independent risk factor for UTIs. If you have diabetes, managing your blood sugar level through a healthy lifestyle and taking medications as prescribed is an important protective strategy. Cranberry juice and probiotics are often touted for UTI prevention. But studies on whether cranberry juice or cranberry pills reduce risk for UTI do not show consistent results. And no research has found that probiotics are effective in treating UTIs or preventing recurrence. If you experience recurrent UTIs — defined as two or more UTIs in six months or three or more UTIs in a year — you may need to consider additional strategies. These include: When UTIs occur, prompt treatment is essential to prevent complications such as kidney infections. Treatment typically involves a short course of antibiotics. It's important to complete the full course as prescribed, even if symptoms improve, to ensure the infection is completely cleared and that symptoms do not recur. For recurrent UTIs, your doctor may recommend: If you're experiencing UTI symptoms or have concerns about recurring infections, talk to your doctor.

           It's fairly common for a medical treatment to cause side effects: think headache, upset stomach, sleepiness, and occasionally more severe side effects. Far more rarely, a side effect provides an unexpected benefit. This might be the case for the shingles vaccine. Shingles is a painful, blistering skin rash caused by the varicella zoster virus responsible for chickenpox. The virus lies dormant in nerve tissue and can reactivate to cause shingles in anyone who has had chickenpox in the past. A vaccine to prevent shingles is recommended for adults ages 50 and older, and for people 19 and older who have an impaired immune system. While we know the shingles vaccine is effective at preventing shingles, evidence is mounting that it might also reduce the risk of dementia. Yes, a vaccination to prevent shingles may lessen your risk of dementia. Dementia is a devastating condition for those affected and their families. Currently, an estimated nine million people in the US have dementia. The number is expected to double by 2060, primarily because of the aging population. In most cases, no highly effective treatments are available. An effective preventive measure could have an enormous impact, especially if it's safe, inexpensive, and already available. Some (though not all) studies have found that having shingles increases your risk of dementia in the future. And that's led researchers to explore the possibility that preventing shingles through vaccination might reduce dementia risk. Several studies suggest this is true. For example: Perhaps the best evidence suggesting that shingles vaccination prevents dementia comes from a natural experiment recently published in the journal Nature. A natural experiment takes advantage of real-world circumstances by dividing people into an exposed group and an unexposed group and then comparing specific outcomes. Natural experiment studies bypass the challenges of having to recruit hundreds or thousands of study subjects who might differ from one another in important ways, or who might alter their behavior because they know they're in a study. The results can be even more valuable than — and as credible as — standard randomized trials. In 2013, Wales made the shingles vaccination available to individuals based on their date of birth: anyone born after September 2, 1933, was eligible, while anyone born before that date was not. Researchers took this opportunity to analyze health records of nearly 300,000 people: half were two weeks older than the cutoff date and half were two weeks younger. The study looked at whether people developed dementia over a seven-year period. Researchers found that compared to those who didn't get the shingles vaccination, those who received it A study of this type cannot prove that shingles vaccination prevents dementia. But along with the studies cited above, there's a strong suggestion that it does. We'll need additional studies to confirm the benefit. We also want to understand other details of the vaccine's effect, such as whether protection applies more to some types of dementia (such as Alzheimer's disease) than others, and whether the effect of vaccination changes over time. With any unexpected finding in science, it's a good idea to ask whether there is a reasonable explanation behind it. Scientists call this biologic plausibility. In general, the more plausible a result is, the more likely it is to hold up in later research. In this case, several lines of reasoning explain how a shingles vaccine might reduce the risk of dementia, including: The observation that women had more protection from dementia than men after shingles vaccination is unexplained. It's possible that the immune response to vaccination is different in women, or that dementia develops differently in women compared with men. All of us can take steps to lower dementia risk, mostly through healthy behaviors such as being active regularly and choosing a healthy diet. Evidence is mounting that shingles vaccination should be added to the list. It's a story worth following. Future studies of the shingles vaccine could even provide insights into how dementia develops, and how to better prevent and treat it. Until then, get your shingles vaccination if you're eligible for it. It can prevent painful episodes of shingles — and may do much more.

           Measles, once considered eliminated in the United States, has been making an unfortunate comeback. With recent outbreaks in various states, health experts are urging some adults to check their vaccination status. While most people are protected, some may need a booster shot to ensure they remain immune. Measles, also called rubeola, is a highly contagious viral infection that spreads through respiratory droplets when an infected person coughs or sneezes. The virus can linger in the air and on surfaces for hours, making it easy to catch if you're not immune. Symptoms typically appear 10 to 14 days after exposure and include: Measles can lead to serious complications, including pneumonia, brain swelling (encephalitis), blindness, hearing loss, and even death, particularly in young children, pregnant women, and people with weakened immune systems. ""We worry about the outbreaks because measles is a highly contagious infection,"" explains Dr. Michelle Chan, an infectious disease physician at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and an instructor in medicine at Harvard Medical School. ""Individuals who have not been immunized, children too young for the vaccine, and those who are immunocompromised can become very ill from measles."" The best way to prevent measles is through vaccination. Prior to the introduction of widespread vaccination programs, measles was responsible for approximately 2.6 million deaths worldwide. In the United States and other developed nations, the initial vaccine is administered between 12 and 15 months of age, followed by a second dose at 4 to 5 years old. Overall, the vaccine has a strong safety profile. Side effects are mostly mild, and the vaccine has no link to autism. The measles vaccine, given as part of the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) shot, provides long-term immunity. A single dose of the MMR vaccine is 93% effective at preventing illness, while two doses increase effectiveness to 97%. However, not everyone has the same level of protection. For example, prior to 1989, one dose of the MMR vaccine was standard, so most people born before 1989 likely received only one dose. According to Dr. Chan, ""One dose of the MMR vaccine is highly effective, but certain populations who are at high risk of exposure — such as health care workers, international travelers, and close contacts of immunocompromised individuals — may want to be proactive about ensuring they've received the full series of vaccinations."" In addition, individuals vaccinated between 1963 and 1967 may have received a less effective, inactivated (killed) version of the measles vaccine. ""Anyone who received the inactivated vaccine or is unsure of the type they received should get one to two doses of the MMR vaccine,"" Dr. Chan advises. If you're not sure of your immunization history and your medical records are unclear, getting an extra dose of the MMR vaccine is a safe and effective option. ""If you are unsure, you can choose to take a dose of the vaccine. It is very safe and not harmful if you happen to receive an additional dose,"" Dr. Chan reassures. Because of the high rates of measles in the U.S. prior to 1957, anyone born before 1957 is presumed to have had measles or been exposed to the virus and, as a result, does not need a measles vaccine or booster shot. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that certain adults check their measles immunity and get a booster shot if necessary. You may need a booster if: If you fall into one of these higher-risk groups, check your vaccination status and speak with your doctor about a measles vaccine booster. ""It all comes back to vaccines — this is our most effective method of preventing measles infection and resurgence,"" Dr. Chan emphasizes.

           Not such good news for butter lovers like myself: seesawing research on how healthy or unhealthy butter might be received a firm push from a recent Harvard study published in JAMA Internal Medicine. Drawing on decades of data gathered through long-term observational studies, the researchers investigated whether butter and plant oils affect mortality. One basic takeaway? ""A higher intake of butter increases mortality risk, while a higher intake of plant-based oil will lower it,"" says Yu Zhang, lead author of the study. And importantly, choosing to substitute certain plant oils for butter might help people live longer. The researchers divided participants into four groups based on how much butter and plant oils they reported using on dietary questionnaires. They compared deaths among those consuming the highest amounts of butter or plant oils with those consuming the least, over a period of up to 33 years. Plant oils won out handily. A 15% higher risk of death was seen among those who ate the most butter compared with those who ate the least. A 16% lower risk of death was seen among those who consumed the highest amount of plant oils compared with those who consumed the least. Higher butter intake also raised risk for cancer deaths. And higher plant oil intake cut the risk for dying from cancer or cardiovascular disease like stroke or heart attack. While the study looked at five plant oils, only soybean, canola, and olive oil were linked with survival benefits. Swapping out a small amount of butter in the daily diet — about 10 grams, which is slightly less than a tablespoon — for an equivalent amount of those plant-based oils was linked with fewer total deaths and fewer cancer deaths, according to a modeling analysis. ""Butter has almost no essential fatty acids and a modest amount of trans fat — the worst type of fat for cardiovascular disease,"" Dr. Walter C. Willett, professor of epidemiology and nutrition at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, noted by email. By contrast, the plant oils highlighted in this study are rich in antioxidants, essential fatty acids, and unsaturated fats, which research has linked to healthier levels of cholesterol and triglycerides and lower insulin resistance. Especially when substituted for a saturated fat like butter, plant oils also may help lower chronic inflammation within the body. Making such substitutions aligns with American Heart Association recommendations and current Dietary Guidelines for Americans for healthful eating that lower risk for chronic disease. And for the butter lovers? ""A little butter occasionally for its flavor would not be a problem,"" says Dr. Willett. ""But for better health, use liquid plant oils whenever possible instead of butter for cooking and at the table."" Try sampling a variety of plant oils, like different olive oils, mustard oil, and sesame oil, to learn which ones you enjoy for different purposes, he suggests. Additionally, a blend or mix of butter with oils — or sometimes a bit of butter on its own — can satisfy taste buds. The study crunched data collected through a questionnaire answered every four years by more than 221,000 adults participating in the Nurses' Health Study, Nurses' Health Study II, and Health Professionals Follow-Up Study. As is true of all observational studies, this type of research can't prove cause and effect, although it adds to the body of evidence. Because most participants were white health care professionals, the findings may not apply to a wider population. The researchers adjusted for many variables that can affect health, including age, physical activity, smoking status, and family history of illnesses like cancer and diabetes. The size of the study, the length of follow-up, and multiple adjustments like these are all strengths.
