Gaza's entire population of around 2.4 million people is at risk of a food crisis ""or worse"" by September, the UN- and NGO-backed Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) said in a report. ""Nineteen months into the conflict, the Gaza Strip is still confronted with a critical risk of famine,"" the IPC said. It said there had been a ""major deterioration"" in the food security situation since its last assessment in October 2024. ""Goods indispensable for people's survival are either depleted or expected to run out in the coming weeks. The entire population is facing high levels of acute food insecurity, with half a million people -- one in five -- facing starvation,"" it said. The consortium, which has developed a five-level famine warning system, found that from April 1 to May 10, 244,000 people in Gaza were in the most critical food security situation -- level five, or ""catastrophe/famine."" It classified another 925,000 as level four, or ""emergency."" The UN's Food and Agriculture Organization warned that Gaza faced ""imminent risk of famine,"" saying agriculture was ""on the brink of total collapse."" It called for the ""immediate"" lifting of the blockade, saying aid like animal feed and veterinary supplies was urgently needed to maintain precious production of items such as milk and eggs, often the last remaining food. Israel, which launched its Gaza offensive after the October 7, 2023 resistance campaign led by Palestinian group Hamas, imposed its current aid blockade on March 2. Last week, the Israeli security cabinet approved plans to expand the military operation, including the ""conquest"" of Gaza and the displacement of its population. ""Families in Gaza are starving while the food they need is sitting at the border,"" said the UN World Food Program's executive director, Cindy McCain. ""It's imperative that the international community acts urgently to get aid flowing into Gaza again. If we wait until after a famine is confirmed, it will already be too late for many people.""  ",NA

She made the remark while speaking at a views-exchange meeting titled “Bangladesh of the future through women’s eyes” at the National Press Club under the banner of “Kotha Bolo Nari” on Monday. Sharmeen said: “Those who fought in 2024, and those who are outside of that – I want to engage you. I want to see you as a social force. I want to see you in the effort to create cyber safety. I want you to have a role in our other activities as well.” She added: “If we cannot ensure safety, women’s development will not occur. If girls are not safe in schools, on the streets, or on public transport, how can they grow in a secure environment? I believe we must pay close attention to this.” “I feel like boys are falling behind. If that continues, it will also create a new kind of concern,” the adviser said. “What you are thinking and what you want is very important to us. Based on that, we want to plan our strategy. We are going to form a social force whose major responsibility will be to connect the ministry directly to your homes.” She added: “The girls we will train will receive gender-related awareness training, physical training, self-defence training, and even paramilitary training. We are preparing to launch this initiative. This will create a platform for women to raise their heads high and confront their challenges.” Stressing the importance of addressing cyberbullying, she said: “Cyberbullying is so widespread that we need to create a dedicated unit for it.” She added: “We need to assign several hundred women to computers, divide responsibilities among them to monitor all day, and build alternative narratives.”",NA

The injured are Hedayet Ullah, 17, and Mohammad Hossain, 16, residents of Jalia Para in Shah Porir Dwip. They are undergoing treatment at Cox’s Bazar General Hospital. Teknaf Upazila Nirbahi Officer (UNO) Sheikh Ehsan Uddin said: “Two Bangladeshi fishermen were shot by Arakan Army rebels while fishing in the Naf River this afternoon. We are investigating the incident in more detail.” Local fishermen said that when the fishermen went to fish in the Bangladesh part of the Naf River in the afternoon, Arakan Army members opened fire at them. Hedayet was shot in the knee and Hossain in the left leg. They were later rescued and admitted to Cox’s Bazar General Hospital. Md Rezaul, a resident of Shah Porir Dwip, said: “In the morning, three fishermen from Shah Porir Dwip went fishing in the Naf river by boat.

This event took place at around 7:15pm in front of the Raju Memorial Sculpture, University of Dhaka. The coalition will arrange a similar program at Central Shaheed Minar on Wednesday on a bigger scale. Earlier, on Sunday, they had arranged a similar program. Leaders and activists from Chhatra Dal, Bangladesh Democratic Students' Council, Bangladesh Students' Union, Revolutionary Student Unity, Student Federation, and cultural organizations, along with general students, were present at the event. The initiative to sing the national anthem together stems from a Shahbag blockade demanding the Awami League's ban, where a group of protesters were reportedly barred from singing the national anthem, after their demands were met on Sunday. Chhatra Dal leaders took the initiative. No organization was approached formally to ensure the general students' participation, according to leaders of the organization. Md Nasir Uddin Shawon, senior joint general secretary of Chhatra Dal's DU unit, told Dhaka Tribune: ""Both the national anthem and national flag are the indicators of our nationality; criticizing them is tantamount to treason and criticizing the Liberation War."" ""I think every party practising politics in Bangladesh should uphold the Liberation War of Bangladesh, or else they should not have the right to practise politics,"" Shawon added. Abdul Kader, convener of DU Bangladesh Democratic Students' Council, said: ""I am not viewing the national anthem as a personal song or a work by Rabindranath Tagore. Instead, we see it as a song of the liberation struggle - an emotional expression of our collective spirit."" One of the organizers of the event, Bijoy Ekattor Hall Chhatra Dal Office Secretary Sakib Biswess, told Dhaka Tribune that there is no surety that those who question the national anthem will not question the national flag and sovereignty. ""We want everyone to follow the way of Bangladesh,"" said Sakib. However, there is one portion of DU students who oppose the idea of singing the national anthem as proof of nationalism. They claim that this idea is the Awami League's narrative. Jamaluddin Muhammad Khalid, convener of Swadhin Bangladesh Chhatra Sangsad, told Dhaka Tribune that a few days ago, there was a plan by Chhatra League and Chayanat to collectively sing the national anthem at the Central Shaheed Minar, which they claimed to have collectively prevented. ""Being a Bangladeshi nationalist or being Bangladeshi is not something you prove by singing the national anthem. The Awami League's narrative that you are not Bangladeshi if you do not sing the anthem was problematic,"" he argued.",NA
https://www.dhakatribune.com///www.dhakatribune.com/opinion/op-ed/381015/india-pakistan-conflict-over-water-reflects-a,India-Pakistan conflict over water reflects a region increasingly vulnerable to climate change,https://www.dhakatribune.com///www.dhakatribune.com/opinion/op-ed/381015/india-pakistan-conflict-over-water-reflects-a,"Weaponizing water is a perilous strategy that may backfire In an unprecedented move, India recently suspended the 1960 Indus Waters Treaty with Pakistan, citing cross-border terrorism. This was one of a series of escalations between the two countries which now find themselves on the brink of war.  The treaty suspension reflects a growing regional trend: South Asian countries are increasingly treating water as a strategic asset rather than a shared resource amid rising mistrust, climate stress and geopolitical competition. The region is home to nearly a quarter of the global population, and relies on huge transboundary rivers fed by Himalayan glaciers -- the so-called “Third Pole”of freshwater reserves. A breakdown in water diplomacy could trigger environmental collapse, humanitarian crises and geopolitical instability. The weaponization of water must be urgently addressed as a global climate justice issue. A lashpoint occurred in August 2024 when devastating floods affected nearly 5.8 million people in Bangladesh. Some Bangladeshi officials accused India of releasing excess water from a large dam upstream without warning. India denied responsibility, citing extreme rainfall and standard dam operations. Nevertheless, the incident reignited longstanding tensions between the two countries.  Complicating matters further is China recently approving the construction of the world’s largest hydropower project on the Yarlung Tsangpo river in Tibet, which becomes the Brahmaputra in India. This massive project has raised alarm about China’s ability to exert control upstream, and the ecological risks for India and Bangladesh downstream. China hasn’t signed formal water-sharing agreements with its neighbours, but its growing presence in regional water infrastructure signals a dramatic shift in south and east Asian hydro-politics. Climate change is making things worse Recent climatic trends are making transboundary rivers an increasing focus of geopolitical friction. These trends include accelerated glacier melt, erratic monsoon patterns, and intensifying extreme weather.  While melting glaciers will temporarily boost the flow of rivers, the long-term prognosis is bleak. If emissions and warming trends continue, many glacier-fed rivers – including the Indus, Ganges and Brahmaputra – could see dramatically reduced flows by the end of the century. This will directly affect hundreds of millions of people who depend on them. The crisis is being intensified by changes in the Himalayas. The region is warming faster than the global average, with a shift from snowfall to rainfall that disrupts the timing and volume of water that flows down from the mountains to the fields and cities below. At the same time, unsustainable groundwater extraction has pushed South Asia’s reserves of underground water toward collapse, threatening both food and water security.  A dangerous precedent A collapse or suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty could set a dangerous precedent. Importantly, the threat is less about India cutting off water flows – an unlikely and technically challenging act – and more about the erosion of trust, transparency and data sharing. One of the treaty’s most valuable features has been the routine sharing of data on things like water levels, river flow and dam operations. Pakistan needs this data to forecast floods and droughts, plan its irrigation, generate hydropower effectively and manage its drinking water, yet India is indicating it will no longer honour these obligations. But India’s strained water relations are not limited to Pakistan. Bangladesh and Nepal have often felt sidelined or pressured in negotiations, and India’s indication that it may reconsider longstanding treaties raises concerns in both countries. This is especially the case as the Ganges Water Treaty nears its 2026 expiration: the vast Ganges river flows through India and irrigates much of Bangladesh – and the treaty guarantees Bangladesh a minimum river flow. Other key agreements, such as the Mahakali Treaty and Kosi river accord with Nepal, and the Teesta water-sharing deal with Bangladesh, remain largely unimplemented, breeding mistrust. These failures undermine confidence in regional water diplomacy and cast doubt on India’s commitment to equitable cooperation.  None of this is helped by India, Pakistan and Bangladesh all continuing to rely on outdated irrigation methods that mean they use more water than necessary. As climate change intensifies floods, droughts and glacial melt, there is an urgent need to reform existing water treaties to reflect present-day climate, hydrological and geopolitical realities.  The Indus Waters Treaty, negotiated in the 1960s before the emergence of modern climate science, no longer accounts for these transformations. Indeed, most water treaties in the region remain rooted in technocratic, engineering-centric frameworks which fail to address extreme climate variability and its cascading impacts. The upcoming expiration of the Ganges Water Treaty, and the pending negotiation of other basin agreements, present a critical opportunity to rethink water governance in South Asia. Though the Indus flows through India before Pakistan, in other basins, India is downstream. This is the case with the Brahmaputra, where it demands upstream cooperation from China. Undermining the Indus treaty could weaken India’s own position in future negotiations and strain its relations with Nepal and Bangladesh, while giving China more influence in South Asian hydro-politics. China is already expanding its footprint by offering billions in loans to Bangladesh and strengthening ties with Nepal, particularly around water infrastructure. Weaponizing water is a perilous strategy that may backfire. The weakening of water diplomacy in South Asia is not just a regional threat; it endangers global climate security. In the face of escalating climate change impacts and recurring disasters, updating transboundary agreements like the Indus Waters Treaty, Ganga Water Treaty, and Kosi and Teesta accords is no longer optional -- it is an urgent necessity with enormous consequences.

https://www.dhakatribune.com///www.dhakatribune.com/opinion/op-ed/380995/the-anatomy-of-human-vulnerability,The anatomy of human vulnerability,https://www.dhakatribune.com///www.dhakatribune.com/opinion/op-ed/380995/the-anatomy-of-human-vulnerability,"Deification always leads to disappointment In the ancient Greek myth of Achilles lies a truth so eternal, so delicately profound, that it continues to echo through the vast corridors of human history: Even the mightiest among us carry within themselves a hidden vulnerability. A soft spot. A weakness. An Achilles heel. Achilles, the demi-god warrior in Homer’s Iliad, was raised to be invincible. His mother, Thetis, dipped him in the sacred River Styx to grant him immortality. But the heel by which she held him remained untouched by the water. That tiny, unprotected patch of skin would become the point of his death -- struck down by an arrow during the Trojan War. This is not merely a tale of mythology. It is a metaphor for the human condition. Strip away the legend and what remains is a universal principle: Every person, no matter how powerful, admired, or wise, bears within them a blind spot -- a flaw, a forgotten wound, or a shadow that can undo them. Our modern world, saturated by technological triumphs and illusions of invincibility, needs this reminder now more than ever. History is a graveyard of powerful men brought low by their own hidden vulnerabilities. Julius Caesar, betrayed by those he trusted. Napoleon, undone by his own ambition. In more recent memory, we have seen empires crumble, corporations collapse, and leaders fall from grace -- not always due to overwhelming external forces, but from internal flaws. Pride. Arrogance. Blindness to their own weaknesses. Carl Jung called this the ""shadow self"" -- the unconscious parts of ourselves we refuse to acknowledge. “Until you make the unconscious conscious,” he warned, “it will direct your life and you will call it fate.” Our downfall does not always arrive like a thunderbolt from above; often it tiptoes in quietly through the very flaw we pretend does not exist. This, too, is echoed in Eastern philosophy. Taoist master Lao Tzu said, “He who knows others is wise; he who knows himself is enlightened.” Yet self-knowledge remains one of the most elusive forms of wisdom in a culture obsessed with image, status, and outward strength. Consider the figures we idolize today -- the billionaires, celebrities, political strongmen. They appear flawless in their control, perfect in their success, unshakable in their dominance. But behind the scenes, many carry the weight of psychological fragility. Depression, addiction, broken relationships, moral contradictions. These are not just the failings of individuals; they are symptoms of a civilization that worships strength and denies vulnerability. Even our technologies -- so often heralded as the triumph of human innovation -- carry their own Achilles heels. The internet, a marvel of connectivity, has become a breeding ground for loneliness. Social media, designed to empower voices, has given rise to cancel culture, misinformation, and societal division. The very tools of progress, if left unchecked, can turn into instruments of decline. Nassim Nicholas Taleb, in his book Antifragile, speaks of systems that become weaker when shielded from stress. “Some things benefit from shocks,” he writes. “They thrive and grow when exposed to volatility, randomness, disorder.” Like the heel of Achilles, that one untested spot becomes the point of destruction. A strength never questioned becomes a weakness waiting to be exposed. The metaphor of the Achilles heel finds a strange ally in modern chaos theory -- specifically the butterfly effect, which suggests that a minor event, like the flap of a butterfly’s wings, can set off a tornado halfway across the world. The message is simple: Small things matter. Overlooked details can spiral into monumental consequences. We must abandon the myth of the flawless hero We are all susceptible to this invisible interdependence. A careless word, a neglected emotion, a missed moment of empathy -- each has the power to alter the trajectory of our lives. In a world so interconnected, humility becomes not just a virtue, but a survival strategy. How often have we witnessed an entire relationship fall apart over a single misunderstanding? Or a movement fail due to one unchecked ego? “The devil is in the details,” they say. But perhaps, more accurately, the divine is in the details too -- teaching us that no act is insignificant, no flaw too small to be dangerous, no strength immune from decay. Across civilizations, the lesson repeats itself. In the Ramayana, Ravana, a brilliant king and warrior, loses everything because of unchecked desire and ego. His downfall is not from external conquest but from internal combustion. In the Mahabharata, the noble Karna -- courageous, loyal, principled -- ultimately loses because he is shackled by personal dilemmas and fatal hesitations. These stories endure because they speak to something fundamental in us: the conflict between greatness and fragility. Every person carries the seeds of both within them. The wise, however, learn to water only one. The 20th-century theologian Reinhold Niebuhr captured this paradox beautifully in his Serenity Prayer: God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change,The courage to change the things I can,And the wisdom to know the difference. It is wisdom, not strength, that saves. And wisdom begins with acknowledging the limits of our power. The danger of self-pride lies not merely in arrogance but in the delusion of invulnerability. When people believe they are beyond harm, they stop guarding their weaknesses. They mock humility, dismiss reflection, and ignore warning signs. But the wise understand: Knowing one’s Achilles heel is not a sign of weakness -- it is a strength in itself. Socrates, who claimed to know nothing, remains one of the most revered thinkers of all time. His greatness lay not in omniscience, but in his endless quest for understanding. In Islam, a recurring theme is the fitrah -- the natural disposition of man toward humility and dependence on the Divine. The Qur’an reminds: “Man was created weak” (Surah An-Nisa 4:28). This is not a condemnation, but an invitation to acknowledge our need for guidance, mercy, and self-correction. The same is echoed in Christian theology, where St Paul writes, “When I am weak, then I am strong” (2 Corinthians 12:10). True strength, in this view, lies in surrender. In knowing one's dependence on something greater than oneself. What then is the path forward? First, we must abandon the myth of the flawless hero. Our leaders, our role models, our institutions -- they must be allowed to be human. Fallibility should not be a disqualifier for greatness but a reminder of the responsibilities that come with power. Second, we must normalize introspection. Schools should teach not just math and science, but emotional awareness and moral reasoning. Workplaces should reward not just results, but integrity and self-awareness. Third, we must reconnect with mystery. The modern world, obsessed with control and measurement, has little room for uncertainty. But life itself is uncertain. And perhaps it is only in bowing to that uncertainty that we find true peace. Rabindranath Tagore wrote: “Faith is the bird that feels the light when the dawn is still dark.”Let us be that bird. Let us carry our wounds with grace, our fears with courage, and our flaws with responsibility. Because life reminds us again and again: strength lies not in being unbreakable, but in being unafraid to break -- and still rise.   HM Nazmul Alam is an academic, journalist, and political analyst based in Dhaka.

Rethink how it is urbanized,https://www.dhakatribune.com///www.dhakatribune.com/opinion/editorial/380994/want-a-cooler-dhaka-rethink-how-it-is-urbanized,"Bangladesh is already classified as one of the most climate-vulnerable nations in the world An especially egregious byproduct of our capital city’s urban planning is the high ambient temperatures that citizens have to deal with for the majority of the year. With Dhaka recording its highest temperature of the season at 39.2°C last Saturday -- a figure that, although alarming, is hardly surprising -- it is high time that we re-evaluated how the city’s urban development is carried out.As Dhaka’s concrete sprawl continues to expand unchecked, the urban heat island effect is worsening, making the environment progressively more inhospitable for living creatures -- the unchecked spread of concrete structures, asphalt roads, and glass towers absorbs and retains heat, pushing temperatures in urban centers far beyond those in surrounding rural areas. Furthermore, poor ventilation, shrinking green spaces, and a lack of thoughtful city design exacerbate the problem, turning Dhaka into a veritable heat trap that compromises both public health and quality of life.The rate and manner upon which we are urbanizing leaves very little scope for nature to co-exist with concrete and the consequences of this are dire. Heat stress is fast becoming a public health crisis that disproportionately affects the working class, who often have little respite from the scorching streets. Children and the elderly are especially vulnerable, and the less said the better about stray animals who often perish due to the the rising temperatures.Given Bangladesh’s inherent nature as a climate-vulnerable country, it is clear that the way we are urbanizing is simply wrong. To rectify it, the government needs to embed sustainability as a core component of our urbanization scheme, which can be achieved by restoring dedicated green spaces and indeed paving the way for more, encouraging more climate-conscious architecture, and increased public awareness campaigns and policies which prioritize quality of life over the profits of vested quarters.",NA

To that end, the recent collapse of a 250-foot road segment in Tungipara, Gopalganj, is just one example of how river erosion can instantly sever vital infrastructure, cutting off access for thousands of people. Villagers who once relied on the Dumuria-Sorabari route now face long and costly detours, affecting commerce, education, and daily mobility.According to a recent Dhaka Tribune report, the road near Chitlia village collapsed around noon on Wednesday after cracks appeared along the Dumuria-Sorabari route. Soon after, a 250-foot stretch was swallowed by the Shaldah River, halting all vehicular and pedestrian movement, resulting in thousands of villagers from Dumuria, Bhairabnagar, Tarail, Jamaibazar, Mamarbazar, Chitlia, Sorabari, and Pakurtia are now forced to take a 10–15km detour via Bashbaria.This is not the exception but the rule as every year, vast stretches of land disappear beneath the currents, swallowing homes, roads, schools, and livelihoods. Families watch helplessly as their settlements erode, forcing them to relocate, rebuild, and restart their lives, often with little government support. Despite the devastating consequences, Bangladesh’s approach to erosion remains reactive rather than preventive, as authorities rush to rebuild roads and homes only after disasters strike, in lieu of investing in long-term prevention strategies.This is unsustainable.Bangladesh has long needed a comprehensive approach to tackle river erosion -- robust embankments, strategic river dredging, afforestation, and modern river training techniques could significantly mitigate the risks. Furthermore, our river management efforts must engage local communities by equipping them with the knowledge and resources to implement sustainable erosion control measures.While tackling river erosion is undoubtedly challenging, it is not an insurmountable issue. But it must be treated as an urgent national priority, with a focus on pro-active intervention rather than temporary fixes.",NA
https://www.dhakatribune.com///www.dhakatribune.com/opinion/op-ed/380912/from-chanakya-to-jaishankar,From Chanakya to Jaishankar,https://www.dhakatribune.com///www.dhakatribune.com/opinion/op-ed/380912/from-chanakya-to-jaishankar,"Crafting a new era in South Asian diplomacy In the heart of New Delhi lies Chanakyapuri -- a verdant enclave of embassies where whispers of diplomacy intermingle with the echoes of a 2,300-year-old strategic legacy. Named after the revered strategist Chanakya (also known as Kautilya), this diplomatic hub serves as a powerful reminder of the enduring significance of strategic thinking in international relations. As Chanakya wisely stated: “The wise king foresees that which is not yet visible, as the mature fruit is foreseen in the blossom” (Arthashastra 15.1). This ancient wisdom, rooted in anticipation and foresight, is particularly relevant as India navigates the complexities of its relationships in South Asia today, including its crucial ties with Bangladesh, a nation that shares both history and aspirations with its neighbour.   As India’s External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar asserts: “Nations must shape the world, not just exist in it,” these timeless teachings remain a guiding force in shaping modern diplomacy and engagement with neighbours.   Chanakya’s Arthashastra: The bedrock of Indian strategic thought Kautilya (Chanakya), the ancient architect of statecraft, authored the Arthashastra as a sophisticated manual for governance that continues to resonate millennia later. His focus on strategic alliances underscores a fundamental instinct for survival through intelligence and cooperation. While his teachings emphasized a pragmatic approach -- often prioritizing realpolitik -- Chanakya also cautioned, “a king shall lose his kingdom if he angers the people.” This insight highlights the necessity for India to balance its national interests with the sentiments of neighbouring populations, including the aspirations and concerns of the Bangladeshi people.   Neighbourhood first policy: Aspirations vs realities The launch of the ""Neighbourhood First"" policy in 2014 marked a pivotal moment in India's foreign relations. India Prime Minister Narendra Modi's aim was to foster closer ties with immediate neighbours such as Bangladesh, Nepal, Bhutan, Sri Lanka, and the Maldives through strategic outreach and engagement. Jaishankar embodies this pragmatic approach, emphasizing that “to be strong is to defend your interests while fostering relationships” (The India Way). However, despite these intentions, the policy has not yielded the expected outcomes.  Recent surveys indicate a rise in anti-India sentiments among neighbouring populations, including Bangladesh, creating a complex landscape that challenges the initial aspirations of this policy. Analysts point out that diplomatic efforts have often been confined to governmental levels, missing the opportunity to resonate with the broader sentiments and aspirations of the people. For instance, issues such as water sharing, trade imbalances and border killings have sparked discontent among Bangladeshis, which underscores the need for more inclusive dialogue. Understanding public sentiment: Lessons from Kautilya Kautilya teaches the importance of winning the hearts of neighbours. He famously stated, “if a ruler fails to win the hearts of his neighbours, he strengthens his enemies” (Arthashastra, 7.3). Understanding the sources of discontent is essential for India as it navigates the intricacies of its relationships with neighbours. S Jaishankar underscores this need for mutual respect and understanding, noting that “India’s relations with its us should be defined by their mutual interests and respect” (The India Way). Recognizing regional sentiments, particularly those of Bangladesh, is vital for India as it seeks to renew its image and foster goodwill. Engaging in cultural exchanges and showcasing shared heritage can play a pivotal role in this endeavour. As India embraces the complexities of South Asian diplomacy, the wisdom of Chanakya offers valuable insights for contemporary challenges Building a cooperative future: Integrating Chanakya and Jaishankar Both Chanakya and Jaishankar advocate for a diplomatic approach that emphasizes respect and cooperation. Kautilya’s insights encourage strategic engagement, while Jaishankar promotes a balanced approach that integrates democracy and moral imperatives into foreign policy.  Both recognize the importance of economic cooperation, cultural exchanges, and addressing regional issues. Encouraging people-to-people contact through joint initiatives in education and trade can deepen understanding and foster goodwill among nations. Additionally, fair trade arrangements, collaborative resource management, and transparency in addressing border issues are foundational for rebuilding trust. Conclusion: A new diplomatic horizon As India embraces the complexities of South Asian diplomacy, the wisdom of Chanakya offers valuable insights for contemporary challenges. His questioning approach serves to guide India in its quest to establish meaningful relationships with its neighbours, particularly Bangladesh. By adopting a diplomatic strategy enriched by understanding, cultural sensitivity, and strategic foresight, India can cultivate a cooperative environment with Bangladesh and its neighbouring countries. This path not only honors the legacy of Chanakya but also aligns with Jaishankar’s vision of a harmonious South Asian neighbourhood, where nations work together toward shared prosperity and lasting peace.

https://www.dhakatribune.com///www.dhakatribune.com/world/europe/381043/uk-govt-to-reduce-legal-immigration,UK govt to reduce legal immigration,https://www.dhakatribune.com///www.dhakatribune.com/world/europe/381043/uk-govt-to-reduce-legal-immigration,"UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer vowed on Monday to ""finally take back control"" of Britain's borders as his government unveiled policies designed to reduce legal immigration. Labour leader Starmer announced he was ending an ""experiment in open borders"" that saw net migration rise to nearly one million people under the previous Conservative government, which lost last year's general election. The government's Immigration White Paper policy document includes plans to cut overseas care workers and increase from five to 10 years the length of time people will have to live in UK before qualifying for settlement and citizenship. English language rules will also be strengthened, with all adult dependents required to demonstrate a basic understanding, while the length of time students can stay in the UK after completing their studies will be reduced. Starmer said the policies would ""finally take back control of our borders,"" recalling the pro-Brexit slogan used at the height of the campaign to leave the European Union in 2016. Labour vowed in its general election manifesto last year to significantly reduce net migration, which stood at 728,000 in the 12 months to last June.  It had peaked at 906,000 in 2023 after averaging 200,000 for most of the 2010s. Starmer, a former human rights lawyer who voted for the UK to remain part of the EU, is under renewed pressure to tackle immigration following the anti-immigration Reform party's gains in recent local elections. Arch-Eurosceptic Nigel Farage's party won more than 670 local council seats as well as its first two mayoral posts. It is also riding high in national polls, while Labour is struggling. However, Starmer's tack to the right on immigration risks alienating Labour's large base of liberal supporters, with the Liberal Democrats and the Greens picking up votes on the left. The premier said that migrants ""make a massive contribution"" to Britain but alleged the country risks becoming an ""island of strangers"" without more controls. He added that he wanted net migration to have fallen ""significantly"" by the next election, likely in 2029, but refused say by how much. ""Every area of the immigration system, including work, family and study, will be tightened up so we have more control,"" he told reporters at a Downing Street press conference. The white paper also includes new powers to deport foreigners who commit offences in the country. Currently, the government is only informed of foreign nationals who receive prison sentences. Under the new arrangements all foreign nationals convicted of offences will be flagged to the government. ""The system for returning foreign criminals has been far too weak for too long,"" interior minister Yvette Cooper said on Sunday. ""We need much higher standards."" The paper also includes new visa controls requiring foreign skilled workers to have a university degree to secure a job in the UK. And to reduce lower skilled migration Cooper has said she aims to cut 50,000 lower-skilled worker visas this year. On the plans to double the length of time before migrants can make settlement or citizenship requests, high-skilled individuals ""who play by the rules and contribute to the economy"" could be fast-tracked, according to Downing Street.  Starmer said Britain has ""had a system that encourages businesses to bring in lower-paid workers, rather than invest in our young people."" Care England, a charity representing the adult care sector, said the decision to close social care visas to new applications from abroad was a ""crushing blow to an already fragile sector."" ""International recruitment wasn't a silver bullet but it was a lifeline. Taking it away now, with no warning, no funding and no alternative is not just short-sighted –- it's cruel,"" said chief executive Martin Green. Starmer is also under pressure to stop the flow of migrants crossing the Channel from France to England on flimsy rubber dinghies.  More than 36,800 made the journey last year, according to British government figures, with several dozen dying. Separate legislation to tackle irregular immigration, called the Border Security, Asylum and Immigration Bill, is currently going through parliament.  ",NA

India is targeting uninhabited border areas for these push-ins, Ashrafuzzaman said on Monday while responding to questions from reporters after a meeting of the advisory committee on law and order at the Ministry of Home Affairs. For instance, he said, several areas of Panchari in Khagrachhari and the char areas of Rowmari in Kurigram have already been used. ""These are places that take time to reach for patrolling units,” the BGB chief said. “So far, 202 individuals have been taken into BGB custody, including 39 Rohingyas.” The BGB director general added that due to tight surveillance in the land border areas, the Indian side could not operate on the ground and instead dropped another 78 people via Indian vessels at a remote char named Manderbaria in the Sundarbans. “The Coast Guard later rescued them. The process is ongoing to send them back to their respective areas. We have lodged a protest through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs,” he added. The BGB chief said India conducted the push-ins on the nights of Wednesday and Thursday. “The BGB has found 202 people in such instances. The BSF is carrying out push-ins from various corners of the border, particularly in areas where there are no inhabitants. They know that physical surveillance is not possible on every inch of the border.” “Some of these 202 people were verified through the Special Branch of police as Bangladeshi nationals. These individuals had gone to India for work at different times over the past two to three years, even as far back as 20 to 25 years ago. Many had children there, and some of these children even received Aadhaar cards or other Indian documents.” “But Indian police and the BSF confiscated those and forcibly pushed them into Bangladesh. The process to send those verified as Bangladeshi citizens back to their respective localities is underway. Among them, 39 have been identified as Rohingyas. Some of these Rohingyas had previously been registered in camps here but had fled to India at some point. They have been sent back to the Rohingya camps through the RRC and UNHCR.” The BGB chief added that an alarming issue has emerged: some of the Rohingyas apprehended had been registered as refugees under the UNHCR in India. “They had ID cards issued there. We are informing the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and UNHCR that this is a blatant human rights violation. Refugees should remain in the country where they were registered.” “The BSF, as usual, is denying the entire matter. They claim to have no knowledge of the events and are saying the Rohingyas had entered India voluntarily and are now returning on their own. We do not accept this,” he added. “We have lodged a protest note through flag meetings and have also contacted the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, urging them to raise the issue with the Indian foreign ministry. If the individuals are indeed Bangladeshi, we are willing to take them back, but through a regular process. It cannot happen through clandestine means,” he said. He added that the BGB has received intelligence that around 200–300 more refugees are currently being held across the border near the Khagrachhari frontier. The BSF is waiting for an opportunity to push them in, he claimed. “But due to heightened BGB patrols and alertness, their efforts have been thwarted over the past two days. Still, they remain in the border areas,” he said.",NA

According to a gazette notification issued by the Ministry of Home Affairs on Monday, the decision was made under Section 18(1) of the Anti-Terrorism (Amendment) Ordinance, 2025. The order, issued by order of the president, takes immediate effect. The ban will remain in place until the conclusion of ongoing judicial proceedings against leaders and activists of the party and its allied bodies at the International Crimes Tribunal (ICT). The order states that from the formation of the government on January 6, 2009, until its ouster in a student-led mass uprising on August 5 last year, the Awami League and its affiliates carried out widespread acts of violence and repression across the country. These included attacks on political opponents and dissenters, enforced disappearances, extrajudicial killings, torture and rape, it adds. The notification says that during the July uprising, the party and its associate bodies were involved in enforced disappearances, murders, burning people alive, massacres, unlawful detentions, inhuman torture, looting, arson, terrorist activities and crimes against humanity. These allegations, it asserts, have been substantiated by both domestic and international reports. A large number of cases related to these allegations are currently pending at the International Crimes Tribunal and other domestic criminal courts. Since the fall of the Awami League government, its members and operatives have allegedly continued to engage in activities aimed at obstructing ongoing judicial proceedings, intimidating the public and threatening national unity and sovereignty. These include attacks on uprising participants, holding provocative processions, distributing anti-state leaflets and making inflammatory statements on social media, particularly by fugitive leaders residing abroad, including the party’s chief, ousted prime minister Sheikh Hasina. The government claims that there have also been attempts to damage public and private property, along with other violations of law and order. Such actions, according to the notification, pose a serious threat to national security, public safety and the legal process. It further states that these activities have instilled fear among plaintiffs and witnesses involved in the ongoing cases and appear intended to derail judicial proceedings. The government maintains that there is sufficient evidence to indicate that the Awami League and its allied organizations have been engaged in illegal and conspiratorial acts aimed at destabilizing the country and spreading terror among the public, similar to the operations of a terrorist group. In view of this, the government declares that all activities by the Awami League and its affiliated, associate and like-minded organization, including publications, media and online communications, propaganda on social media, rallies, meetings, processions, and conferences, are prohibited until the legal proceedings are concluded.",NA

After their first talks since US President Donald Trump launched his trade war, the world's two biggest economies agreed in a joint statement to bring their triple-digit tariffs down to two figures and continue negotiations. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent described the weekend discussions with Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng and international trade representative Li Chenggang as ""productive"" and ""robust,"" while both sides are anticipated to meet again soon. ""Both sides showed a great respect,"" Bessent told reporters. Trump's fresh duties on many imports from China came up to 145% compared to 10% for other countries in the global tariff blitz he launched last month. Beijing hit back with duties of 125% on US goods. The United States agreed to lower its tariffs on Chinese goods to 30% while China will reduce its own to 10%. Bessent told CNBC Monday that he expects United States and Chinese representatives to meet again in the coming weeks to work out ""a more fulsome agreement."" While Washington does not want a broad decoupling from China, ""what we do want is a decoupling for strategic necessities"" the country had trouble obtaining during the Covid-19 pandemic, Bessent said. He added to CNBC that the purpose of the 90-day pause was also to see what the United States could do about non-tariff barriers weighing on US firms.  China hailed the ""substantial progress"" made at the talks, which were held at the discreet villa residence of Switzerland's ambassador to the United Nations in Geneva. ""This move... is in the interest of the two countries and the common interest of the world,"" the Chinese commerce ministry said, adding that it hoped Washington would keep working with China ""to correct the wrong practice of unilateral tariff rises."" Stock markets and the dollar, which tumbled after Trump unleashed global tariffs, rallied on the announcement. The US tariff rate remains higher than China's because it includes a 20% levy put in place over US complaints about Chinese exports of chemicals used to make fentanyl, US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer told reporters. ""Those remain unchanged for now,"" he said, adding though that ""both the Chinese and United States agreed to work constructively together on fentanyl and there is a positive path forward there as well."" In their joint statement, the two sides agreed to ""establish a mechanism to continue discussions about economic and trade relations."" ""I think we leave with a very good mechanism to avoid the unfortunate escalations,"" Bessent said, noting that the tariffs had essentially created a trade ""embargo"" between the two superpowers. He added that ""the nature of what has happened since April 2 could have been avoided if we had had this kind of mechanism in place.""  The Chinese commerce ministry said ""the two sides will conduct rolling consultations on a regular or ad hoc basis in China, the US or agreed third countries."" Zhiwei Zhang, president and chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management, said in a note the outcome of the weekend meeting was particularly a ""success"" for Beijing. ""China took a tough stance on the US threat of high tariffs and eventually managed to get the tariffs down significantly without making concessions,"" he said. Wang Wen, Dean of Chongyang Institute for Financial Studies at Renmin University of China, said the agreement had ""exceeded expectations"", hailing ""the biggest easing of tensions... since the global tariff war"" began. He cautioned though that ""uncertainties"" remained, warning that without progress over the next 90 days ""it is possible that the tariff war will resume."" The trade dispute between Washington and Beijing has rocked financial markets, raising fears the tariffs would rekindle inflation and cause a global economic downturn. The Geneva meeting came days after Trump unveiled a trade agreement with Britain, the first with any country since his flurry of new tariffs on both friend and foe. The head of the World Trade Organization, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, praised the talks on Sunday as a ""significant step forward.""  ",NA

He made the announcement while briefing reporters after the ninth meeting of the Law and Order Advisory Committee at the Secretariat on Monday. “A committee has already been formed to oversee RAB’s reorganization,” he said, adding that police personnel will no longer be allowed to carry lethal weapons.

Welcoming the report, the adviser said it was a positive step, and the government has decided to act accordingly. Turning to the readymade garment (RMG) sector, the adviser said wages and bonuses of garment workers must be paid before Eid-ul-Azha. He warned of stern action if workers took to the streets with what he termed “irrational” demands.

Kuet authorities said the notices contain seven allegations, including misconduct towards teachers. The students have been asked to respond by 5pm on Thursday. Prof Dr Abdullah Elias Akhter, director of student welfare at Kuet, said the notice was issued based on the findings of the investigation committee formed during the syndicate meeting held on February 19. Meanwhile, teachers of Kuet refrained from taking classes for the sixth consecutive day since academic activities resumed. They remain firm in their decision not to take classes or examinations until punishment is enforced on the students accused of harassing teachers. Additionally, the teachers declared that if disciplinary action is not implemented by Thursday, they will also abstain from administrative duties. Kuet Teachers’ Association President Prof Dr Md Shahidul Islam said they will hold a general meeting and decide on further actions once their demands are fulfilled. Several students who received the notice said that among the 37 students, the first seven are activists of Chhatra Dal, while the rest are general students. They claimed that the general students only took part in protests demanding the vice-chancellor’s resignation and did not harass any teachers. Since the clash on February 18, classes and examinations at Kuet have remained suspended, causing growing concern among the 7,500 students over potential academic session delays. At an emergency syndicate meeting on April 14, a decision was made to suspend the 37 students involved in the incidents on February 18 and 19. The meeting also instructed that the matter be referred to the university’s student disciplinary committee for further action based on the investigation report. Later, the students launched an indefinite hunger strike demanding the resignation of the vice-chancellor. Even the intervention of the education adviser failed to break the strike. On April 23, during the 102nd emergency syndicate meeting, the suspension order was withdrawn. A notification signed by Kuet Registrar Md Anisur Rahman Bhuiyan stated that, based on the decision of the 101st emergency syndicate meeting held on April 14, all academic activities would resume from May 4, and residential halls would reopen on May 2. Prior to this, students had begun protesting and staging sit-ins on campus from April 13, demanding the reopening of the halls. As the authorities fixed May 2 as the reopening date, students forcibly entered six male halls by breaking the locks on April 15 after spending two nights under the open sky. On the night of April 22, female students similarly broke the lock of Rokeya Hall and entered. Currently, all halls at Kuet are occupied by students. Meanwhile, during a press briefing on April 23, the Kuet Teachers’ Association announced they will not accept the removal of the vice-chancellor unless any wrongdoing is proven. Otherwise, they would indefinitely suspend academic activities. Despite the reopening of academic activities on May 4, teachers have continued their class boycott.",NA

US President Donald Trump announced the truce late Saturday after four days of missile, drone and artillery attacks which killed at least 60 people and sent thousands fleeing on both sides. The phone call between the heads of military operations due at 12pm comes after the Indian army reported the ""first calm night in recent days"" in Kashmir and along its western border with Pakistan. Abdul Basit at the S Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore said that the talks would be about modalities of the ceasefire and not policy decisions. The aim is to ""avoid any miscalculations, because right now one spark could quickly move towards a nuclear catastrophe,"" Basit told AFP. The flare-up in violence was the worst since the rivals' last open conflict in 1999 and sparked global shudders that it could spiral into full-blown war. There were initial doubts as the rivals accused each other of breaching the ceasefire just hours after it was unexpectedly announced by Trump on social media. ""The night remained largely peaceful across... Kashmir and other areas along the international border,"" the Indian army said.  ""No incidents have been reported, marking the first calm night in recent days,"" the statement added.  It was also the second straight night without gunfire or shelling at Poonch, a frontier town in the part of divided Kashmir administered by India.  Top India and Pakistan military officials held briefings late Sunday with each claiming the upper hand and warning they were ready to respond if there were fresh attacks. ""We have delivered the promise we made to our people"", Pakistan's Military Spokesman Lieutenant General Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry said, calling it a ""success on the battleground"". ""We re-established deterrence and neutralised key threats"", Pakistani Air Vice Marshal Ahmed Aurangzeb told reporters. ""We have thus far exercised immense restraint so far and our actions have been focused, measured and non-escalatory,"" said Indian Lieutenant General Rajiv Ghai. But he added: ""Any threat to the sovereignty, territorial integrity and safety of our citizens will be met with decisive force,"" he added. Poonch was one of the worst-hit places in India, with at least 12 residents killed and most of the estimated 60,000 residents fleeing their homes.  On Sunday, people started trickling back, although many were still jittery about the ceasefire. Abdul Razzak returned after fleeing with four children and two other relatives on two motorbikes with nothing but their clothes.  ""It was our worst nightmare... We've seen our people die around us, so none of us want a war,"" the 50-year-old told AFP after returning to his house. Thousands of schools remained closed across Pakistan-administered Kashmir as areas were cleared of debris from strikes and firing, said local official Naveed-Ul-Hassan Bukhari. The alarming spiral towards all-out conflict began before dawn on Wednesday, when India launched missile attacks destroying what it called ""terrorist camps"" in the Pakistani part of Kashmir. This followed an April 22 attack on tourists in Indian-administered Kashmir, which killed 26 civilians. India accused Pakistan of backing the attack but Islamabad denied involvement and immediately responded to the strikes with heavy artillery fire. It claimed to have downed five Indian fighter jets -- something New Delhi has not commented on. Militants have stepped up operations in Kashmir since 2019, when Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Hindu nationalist government revoked the region's limited autonomy and took it under direct rule from New Delhi. Divided Muslim-majority Kashmir is claimed in full by both countries, who have fought several wars over the territory since their independence from Britain in 1947.",NA

The chief prosecutor said the investigation agency implicated the ousted prime minister in inciting crimes against humanity through her July 14 press briefing, where she described the anti-discrimination protesters as grandchildren of Razakars. “She unleashed the various law enforcement and intelligence agencies on them (the protesting students). Apart from the state agencies, armed members of the Awami League and its associate bodies like Jubo League and Chhatra League swooped on the protesters with all their might. They slaughtered the agitating students, injured them, and committed crimes against humanity,” Tajul said. The ICT chief prosecutor said the probe body, in the second charge, accused Hasina of giving direct orders to commit crimes against humanity. “The investigation agency seized records of some telephonic conversations of Sheikh Hasina, where she repeatedly ensured that she ordered all the state agencies to eliminate all the innocent civilians who were protesting peacefully for a fair demand, by using helicopters, drones, and APCs (armoured personnel carriers),” he added. The three other charges were related to particular incidents where crimes were committed following the directions of Hasina, the chief prosecutor confirmed.",NA

They made the announcement during a rally at the university’s Shanto Chattar around noon on Monday. The declaration came with the consensus of teachers and students from various departments, as well as representatives from Chhatra Shibir, Chhatra Dal, Chhatra Odhikar Parishad, active student organizations, and cultural groups. Mahthab Hossain Limon, general secretary of the university’s journalists’ association, announced the program on their behalf. He said: “Tomorrow (Tuesday), our delegation will submit a memorandum to the UGC and the Ministry of Education. If our demands are not accepted, we will stage a Jamuna encirclement program on Wednesday.” Raihan Hasan Rabbi, general secretary of the JnU Chhatra Odhikar Parishad, said: “We will continue our movement until the housing allowance and other logical demands are fulfilled.” Asadul Islam, president of the JnU unit of Chhatra Shibir, said: “Today, all teachers and students of JnU are united. If our demands are ignored, the government will have to face a serious situation.” Mehedi Hasan Himel, convener of JnU Chhatra Dal, said: “We have stood by students’ rightful demands in the past, and we will continue to do so. If needed, tougher programs will be announced.” Joining the rally, Associate Professor Nasir Uddin of the English Department said: “Since its inception, Jagannath University has been a victim of discrimination. While Dhaka University receives a Tk900 crore budget, JnU gets only Tk150 crore.” He added: “The UGC always argues that the budget cannot be increased by more than 10%. We want this inequality to end.” Prof Dr Rais Uddin, general secretary of the university teachers’ association and chairman of the Islamic Studies department, said: “Jagannath University is a bearer of history and tradition. In the past, there have been repeated attempts to suppress students’ movements for their rights by labelling them.” He added: “While other universities have halls and housing facilities, JnU is still deprived. If the demands are not met, the teachers’ association will also announce a complete shutdown.” Prof Dr Sabina Sharmin, treasurer of the university, said: “We have always stood by the students’ logical demands. The process of handing over the second campus to the army was also made successful due to the student movement.” Alongside teachers and students from various departments, leaders of cultural, journalistic, and student organizations also took part in the rally.",NA

He held a high-level meeting with the envoys, including from the US, the UK, Canada, the European Union and the ILO, at the Chief Adviser’s Office in Tejgaon to review the past eight months of progress on labour reforms and outline the government's roadmap ahead. He was joined by technical experts and labour rights specialists. Lutfey delivered the first full summary of the government’s reform efforts since July 2024. “Over the past eight months, we have made dramatic progress,” Lutfey said. “The ILO roadmap is not just a guide — it is a commitment. We are investing time, energy and goodwill to get this right both in terms of process and outcome."" He commended the personal engagement and moral authority of Labour Adviser Brig Gen (Retd) Dr M Sakhawat Hussain, who spent hours with tripartite stakeholders to bring them along. Labour Secretary AHM Shafiquzzaman said: “We are targeting July 2025 for the conclusion of labour law amendments and other substantial milestones. The process is moving fast.” European Union Ambassador Michael Miller called the process “unprecedented,” adding: “We note that there’s been a lot of social dialogue and we appreciate the sense of urgency. We look forward to seeing the draft legislation soon and track tangible improvements on the ground. Resolution of this has implications for continued access to EU markets.” US Chargé d’Affaires Tracey Ann Jacobson said: “We welcome the momentum under the current government and would also like to see accountability for past violations.” Canadian High Commissioner Ajit Singh added: “We appreciate the work done so far and support the ILO roadmap. This is particularly important for Bangladesh in the context of LDC graduation.” British High Commissioner Sarah Cooke said: “Bangladesh’s LDC graduation must be backed by strong labour standards. I echo others in expressing my appreciation for the seriousness with which the interim government of Bangladesh has approached this issue.” ILO Country Director Tuomo Poutiainen said: “We’re very close to shaping the updated Bangladesh Labour Act. What matters now is doing this in a way that stands the test of time and protects workers in the long run.” Legislative Secretary Dr Hafiz Ahmed Chowdhury said: “We have made substantial legal progress, and our team is working closely with stakeholders”. Lutfey also briefed the diplomats on earlier inter-ministerial meetings with the home, labour, and public administration ministries to address politically motivated cases from the previous regime, better dispute resolution mechanisms to avert a logjam in courts, and the issue of insufficient capacity in inspector roles. “This is not just a domestic issue. Labour rights are now tied to market access, global trade decisions, including the tariff agenda of President Trump. We must act accordingly,” Lutfey said. The diplomats agreed that labour reforms and accountability must remain a priority across all political contexts. Several reaffirmed their countries’ commitment to supporting Bangladesh’s transition. “The July uprising provides a unique opportunity for the Bangladesh government to do the right thing. We are grateful for the support from everyone as we approach the final stretch towards closing the case at the ILO governing board,” Lutfey said.",NA

The 65-year-old Italian will become Brazil's first foreign coach, with Xabi Alonso set to be appointed as the new Real Madrid boss after confirming his exit from Bayer Leverkusen last week. ""The greatest national team in the history of football will now be led by the most successful coach in the world,"" said the CBF in a statement. ""He will lead Brazil until the 2026 World Cup and will coach them in their next two qualifying matches against Ecuador and Paraguay next month."" Brazil sacked Dorival Junior after a 4-1 thrashing by Argentina in March and are fourth in the South American qualifying table for the tournament in the United States, Mexico and Canada. ""Bringing Carlo Ancelotti to lead Brazil is more than a strategic move -- it's a statement to the world that we are determined to regain the top spot on the podium,"" said CBF president Ednaldo Rodrigues. ""He's the greatest coach in history and now he's in charge of the greatest team on the planet. ""Together, we will write glorious new chapters for Brazilian football."" Record five-time World Cup winners Brazil last won the trophy in 2002, enduring more than two decades of disappointment since then. Ancelotti leaves Madrid as one of the club's most successful managers, winning 15 trophies across two spells with Los Blancos, including a La Liga and Champions League double last season. In his first spell at Real Madrid he led them to La Decima in 2014 -- their 10th Champions League triumph. He has won the competition three times with Los Blancos. After being sacked in 2015 he returned six years later when Zinedine Zidane resigned to lift the trophy again in 2022 and 2024. Ancelotti has also led Chelsea, Paris Saint-Germain and Bayern Munich among other teams, including AC Milan with whom he won the Champions League twice as a coach in 2003 and 2007. The Italian is the coach who has won the European Cup most often, triumphing on five occasions -- two more than Zidane, Pep Guardiola and Bob Paisley.     At Real Madrid, Ancelotti has coached Brazil stars Vinicius Junior, Rodrygo Goes and Eder Militao, as well as teenage talent Endrick. The coach will leave Madrid on May 25 after the club's final La Liga match of the season, against Real Sociedad. Madrid are set to finish the season empty-handed after losing the Clasico at Barcelona on Sunday to fall seven points behind their league leading arch-rivals. Ancelotti will oversee Madrid's home game against Mallorca on Wednesday and the trip to Sevilla on May 18, departing before the Club World Cup this summer in the US. The coach has won league titles in the five major European leagues, in Spain, England, Italy, Germany and France across a 30-year managerial career. Spanish media reported Monday that Leverkusen coach Alonso is set to take over at Real Madrid on June 1, ahead of the Club World Cup. Madrid's first match is against Saudi side Al Hilal in Miami on June 18.",NA

From sleek 4K smart TVs to budget-friendly Android models, the choices today are broader than ever. As Bangladeshi households upgrade from basic LED units to smart TVs with integrated streaming platforms, understanding which brands offer the best value, features, and reliability has never been more important. In 2025, several key brands are shaping the consumer TV experience across different price segments. Samsung continues to dominate the premium segment in Bangladesh. Known for its cutting-edge display technology, Samsung’s QLED and Crystal UHD TVs deliver stunning picture quality, sharp contrasts, and rich colors. The company’s proprietary Tizen operating system offers a fluid smart TV interface, with seamless access to popular apps like Netflix, YouTube, and Amazon Prime. Samsung televisions are also known for their longevity and are supported by an extensive after-sales network across Bangladesh. While the price tag may be on the higher end, many consumers see it as a long-term investment in quality and performance. Samsung TVs are widely available through major retailers, including Star Tech, where official models with warranty coverage are frequently stocked. LG, another South Korean electronics giant, is equally prominent in the Bangladeshi market. The brand has earned a reputation for its OLED TVs, which offer deep blacks, precise color calibration, and immersive viewing angles—ideal for movie lovers and gaming enthusiasts alike. LG’s WebOS is one of the most user-friendly smart TV interfaces, offering fast performance and intelligent features through LG ThinQ AI. In both design and durability, LG TV continues to impress, especially in the mid-to-high-end categories. With local availability and solid warranty support, LG remains a go-to choice for consumers looking for innovation and reliability. Sony maintains its position as one of the most respected TV brands worldwide, and in Bangladesh, it appeals strongly to those prioritizing premium image and sound quality. Sony’s Bravia series, now powered by Google TV, provides a refined experience that combines brilliant 4K visuals with cinematic audio output. Sony TVs excel in motion handling, making them a favorite among sports fans and film enthusiasts. Though generally more expensive than competitors, Sony products are synonymous with excellence and tend to perform consistently well for years. For buyers willing to invest in high-end performance, Sony is a name that continues to deliver. For added assurance, purchasing from trusted sources like Star Tech helps ensure you’re getting original Sony TVs with official warranty support. Chinese brand Hisense is making steady inroads into the Bangladeshi market by offering high-spec TVs at competitive prices. Known for producing budget and mid-range smart TVs with features like Dolby Vision, HDR10+, and built-in Chromecast, Hisense has become a popular alternative for those seeking quality without a premium price. The brand’s adoption of Google TV across many of its new models adds to its appeal, allowing users to access a wide array of apps and streaming platforms. Hisense televisions are increasingly available in major electronics stores and online platforms in Bangladesh. Star Tech, among others, regularly features Hisense TV models for buyers seeking reliable, feature-rich televisions on a tighter budget. Haier, traditionally known for home appliances, has been expanding its TV lineup in Bangladesh with a focus on affordability and smart functionality. Haier TVs are generally targeted at mid-range buyers who want modern features like Android TV OS, voice control, and HDMI-ARC support without the steep costs associated with top-tier brands. While not as technologically advanced as Samsung or LG, Haier TVs are known for their decent picture quality and stable performance. Their growing presence in both physical retail and e-commerce makes them an accessible choice for many households upgrading to smart TVs for the first time. Xiaomi, the tech disruptor from China, continues to shake up the smart TV market in Bangladesh. Best known for offering smart features at aggressive prices, Xiaomi TVs run on Android TV and feature Xiaomi’s PatchWall interface, which integrates content from various streaming platforms into a unified dashboard. The brand’s popularity among younger buyers stems from its sleek design, reliable 4K resolution panels, and frequent software updates. Xiaomi’s offerings are particularly strong in the 32-inch to 55-inch category, making them ideal for small apartments and medium-sized living rooms. Star Tech is one of the leading retailers where Xiaomi smart TVs are available with competitive pricing and after-sales support. Singer, one of the most recognizable names in Bangladesh’s consumer electronics landscape, has also expanded its smart TV range in recent years. While once known primarily for basic LED televisions, Singer now offers smart TVs that feature Android operating systems, HD and FHD resolutions, and slim designs. With a strong local presence and competitive pricing, Singer TV is often considered a reliable option for budget-conscious consumers. The brand also benefits from an extensive service network throughout the country, giving it an edge when it comes to after-sales support and warranty fulfillment. In 2025, the television market in Bangladesh is more vibrant than ever. Consumers now prioritize smart functionality, display quality, and brand reliability just as much as they consider price. Samsung, LG, and Sony continue to lead the high-end and premium segments with technological innovation and strong brand trust. At the same time, brands like Xiaomi, Hisense, Haier, and Singer offer attractive alternatives that meet the needs of budget-conscious buyers without compromising too much on modern features. For buyers across Bangladesh—from Dhaka to Chittagong, Sylhet to Rajshahi—authorized retailers like Star Tech have become trusted destinations for purchasing genuine TVs with official warranties and after-sales service. Whether you’re upgrading for better streaming, gaming, or simply enjoying cable with higher clarity, there’s now a TV brand in Bangladesh perfectly suited to your lifestyle.",NA

He is set to launch ""What"" (www.what.net.in), an innovative online shopping platform with a unique social mission. A particular portion of the profits from this business will be directly allocated to developing an AI-based SOS Alert Mechanism aimed at preventing teenage rape across Bangladesh. Sadat’s vision is not just to build a successful business, but to create meaningful social impact through entrepreneurship. By leveraging the power of AI technology, he hopes to provide faster and smarter emergency responses for teenagers in danger, addressing a critical gap in child protection mechanisms. This initiative reflects Sadat's continued commitment to using modern technology as a tool for social good. The establishment of ""What"" has been further strengthened with the support and guidance of Ejazur Rahman Sajal, assistant professor of Business Administration at Daffodil International University. His mentorship has been instrumental in shaping Sadat’s approach to combining business innovation with social responsibility. This new venture marks another milestone in Sadat's already remarkable journey as a child and human rights activist. Born on March 22, 2009, Shahi Al Sadat founded The Startup IO in 2021 before even turning 13. Under his leadership, the organization has introduced several pioneering initiatives including Kids Helplink, Startup Cyber, the Anti-Harassment Committee, GirlsTeenSafe, and the internationally recognized Teen-X mobile application, which combats human trafficking and teenage sexual violence. Through his leadership, The Startup IO has successfully handled over 300 cases related to child marriage and violations of child rights. His help management system has contributed to the arrest of nine perpetrators over the last two years. Operating across seven districts in Bangladesh—Meherpur, Sylhet, Munshiganj, Rangpur, Dinajpur, Nilphamari, and Moulvibazar—the organization has reached more than 100,000 teenagers through online and offline awareness campaigns. Sadat’s exceptional work has earned him both national and international accolades. In 2024, he was nominated for the prestigious International Children’s Peace Prize and received the National Tech Award for his impactful contributions to digital safety and child rights advocacy. He has also been invited as a speaker at TEDx 2025 at Daffodil International University, where his message will be shared with an audience exceeding 45 million people worldwide. Furthermore, his dedication has been recognized academically with a fully funded scholarship from Rice University in Texas, US, for the Women, Gender & Sexuality Studies program, beginning in Fall 2027. Despite these extraordinary achievements, Sadat remains a humble student, currently preparing for his SSC 2025 examinations. He attributes his success to the unwavering support of his father, Md Shafikul Islam, whose encouragement he cites as the foundation of every milestone he has reached. Sadat also holds deep admiration for his closest friend, Maisha Maliha, acknowledging her as a constant source of support throughout his journey. ""When everyone else turned away, Maliha stood beside me. I will always be grateful to her. I hope our friendship remains unshaken for a lifetime,"" Sadat shared emotionally. In addition to the upcoming launch of ""What,"" Sadat’s organization, The Startup IO, is preparing to introduce another groundbreaking project—the FreeMind App, an AI-powered mental health platform designed to reduce mental health disorders among students. The app is expected to launch on the Google Play Store on August 12, 2025. With unwavering determination, Sadat stated: ""I am determined to raise Bangladesh’s name and flag on the global stage. My mission is to eliminate child trafficking and teenage rape from this nation."" Through ""What"" and his continuing activism, Shahi Al Sadat is not only bringing pride to Bangladesh but also inspiring a global generation of young changemakers.",NA
https://www.dhakatribune.com///www.dhakatribune.com/feature/travel/379162/a-ride-on-the-dark-night-express,A ride on the Dark Night Express,https://www.dhakatribune.com///www.dhakatribune.com/feature/travel/379162/a-ride-on-the-dark-night-express,"Jamuna Fertiliser Company helped put Tarakandi on the map, but the area’s rail tracks tell stories dating back to colonial times “Let us have tea,” he told me, and walked into a tea stall without giving me the chance to say no. Barely five minutes had passed since I met him. To say he met me would be more appropriate, as he struck up a conversation when I was wandering on the platform and observing the vicinity. I do not drink tea but still followed him into the shop as he said he works for the railway. jwARI.fetch( $( ""#ari-image-jw682241c537e25"" ) ); Such a person, I thought, could give me clues that would help me find the answer to my question. For nearly a month, I had been contemplating who boards an intercity train that starts from a small, rural railway station at 2am. I had naively assumed no such train in Bangladesh begins its journey between midnight and 6am, until I came to know about Jamuna Express. This train runs every day between Dhaka and the Tarakandi station in Jamalpur, a north-central district on the bank of the Jamuna River. By the time I arrived at the station, it was already past midnight. Adjusting the balaclava to keep only my eyes bare, I prepared for a long wait on a cold December night. “I guess a variety of passengers take this train at this hour – job holders, traders, and those having day-to-day affairs in various districts of the Mymensingh division,” the bearded railway worker replied when I enquired about the Jamuna Express passengers’ characteristics. Sipping tea from the cup and puffing on a cigarette, he further said there might also be passengers who would catch a bus or another train from Dhaka in the morning to travel elsewhere, thus needing to board this train in the middle of the night. At this stage, he gave me his name – Sujan. I covered my cup with both hands so as not to let him see that it was still almost full while his one was about to be empty. jwARI.fetch( $( ""#ari-image-jw682241c537e47"" ) ); The shop owner, with one of his hands amputated, was adeptly making tea for other customers sitting on plastic chairs scattered outside. The way he talked to Sujan indicated they already knew each other. Some folks were watching the news on the TV placed on a plank in a corner. “If you want to ride this train, you have to leave for the Tarakandi station probably at or after midnight, depending on where you live. International flight departures between midnight and 6am are common, but this is the only Bangladeshi intercity train that starts rolling in total darkness. It is the day’s first train,” Sujan kept on explaining to satisfy my curiosity. “So, we can call it the Dark Night Express?” I suggested. He slightly nodded but maintained nonchalance in his face, as if it did not matter if the Dark Night Express was a misnomer. Our conversation ended abruptly when one of his co-workers requested his presence on the platform. My hands felt the cool winter breeze as I watched the short range of activities at the station. A female artist was rendering a folk song on TV at the tea stall right next to the station building, drawing a small crowd. Boys in groups walked back and forth on the platform, chatting, laughing, and occasionally talking loudly. In the station master's room were several people talking to the official who sat at the computer desk. Around the corner was the ticket counter where two to three men stood, leaving me wondering whether they would buy physical tickets. Outside the counter, on the dirty floor, slept two persons, their bodies enveloped in blankets and the air filled with the stench of urine from the adjacent toilet. Lights of various intensities coming from different directions blended into the mist and turned the station into an artwork of chiaroscuro. Behind the station appeared banana and other trees as well as a few tin-roofed houses, with faint lights coming through some of the windows. The locomotive’s roar, which cut through the silence of the night, could be heard from yards away. Set up in 1991, Jamuna Fertiliser Company has helped put Tarakandi on the map, but the area’s rail tracks tell stories dating back to colonial times. The red-brick station building, typical of the British era, was built during the Mymensingh-Jagannathganj line’s construction in 1898–99. The now defunct Jagannathganj Ghat station on the Jamuna bank had ferry services between the eastern and western districts of present-day Bangladesh. Jute grew galore in the alluvial land of flood-prone Jamalpur, which was named after Shah Jamal who came from Yemen to preach Islam during the reign of Mughal emperor Akbar. Rail lines were built to facilitate the cash crop’s transportation to Dhaka and the inland port of Narayanganj, from where it was shipped to Kolkata. Jamalpur’s Sarishabari upazila, where the Tarakandi station is located, was a flourishing jute trade hub, earning as much prominence as Narayanganj, known as the Dundee of Bangladesh. That glory is now lost because of the closure of jute mills one after another, rendering thousands of workers unemployed and forcing many to change professions. Not far from the Sarishabari station are Alhaj Jute Mills and ARA Jute Mills, both closed over the last decade. But mustard, another major crop of Sarishabari, still retains its glory, with many people visiting the huge swathes of yellow mustard fields in winter to soak in the mesmerising beauty. “There are three Dhaka-bound trains from Tarakandi every day. Jamalpur Express and Aghnibina Express leave in the afternoon/evening and reach Dhaka at 10:40pm at the earliest. If you want to be in Dhaka in the daytime, Jamuna Express is your only option,” explained the man sitting next to me when I asked him why he had taken the train, which left Tarakandi two minutes late. “But passengers can take the bus early in the morning and avoid the night journey. They can have a good night’s sleep at home and set off for Dhaka in the morning in a fresh mood. Plus, the bus reaches Dhaka faster than the train,” I disputed. “Yes, but there could be traffic jams and other uncertainties on the road. Besides, many do not prefer the bus ride. Additionally, there are passengers who do not think like you when it comes to a good night’s sleep. You can travel in first class if you need more comfort and better sleep,” he refuted. I could not contradict him more. Our Shovon Chair carriage, which had 17 passengers when we left Tarakandi, was not designed for ultimate comfort. The maroon seats were not padded and there was not enough legroom, while my reclining lever did not work. The train’s vacuum-brake coaches are very old but heavy-duty, I remembered Sujan saying. He did not remember any bizarre or memorable incident happening on board on the Dhaka–Tarakandi route, which he had been serving continuously for a year. He seemed to have a liking for the classic blue-yellow carriages that were in fashion when millennials like me were growing up. Many travellers curled up on their seats, trying to get some sleep as the clank of wheels on tracks filled the compartment. I walked to the door and leaned out, looking at the nightscape featuring outlines of paddy fields, the sway of nearby tree leaves and branches in the strong wind produced by the speeding train, and occasional rural homes in the distance. A teen boy standing nearby said he had boarded the train because he needed to travel to Dhaka at night. The Tarakandi–Mymensingh route looks almost like a semicircle, with the Jamalpur–Mymensingh stretch running along the old Brahmaputra channel. The stations came alive when the train screeched to a halt as passengers, attired in elaborate warm clothes, scrambled to find the doors of their respective compartments. Under the inky black sky, the Jamalpur station, where we reached at around 3:15am, was engulfed in thick fog, which diffused the overhead and outdoor lights, creating a spotlight effect. I very much wanted to enjoy the foggy landscape bathed in the golden hues of the early morning light – a scene you can witness only during the short-lived winter – but missed it. Waking up to the chit-chat of passengers, I noticed on the map that we had crossed the Mymensingh division and were on our way to Joydebpur. Hawkers squeezed through the aisle of the packed carriage to sell tea and snacks.

While the global influence of modern media has led to a decline in traditional circus performances, rural Bangladesh still retains a few places where this art form continues to flourish. One such troupe is the Rajmoni Circus, based in Thakurgaon, Bangladesh. For many years, Rajmoni Circus has traveled throughout Bangladesh, continuing to captivate audiences with its thrilling performances. At Rajmoni Circus, spectators can experience a variety of exciting performances. One of the most popular acts includes the daredevil performers who leap from great heights, executing acrobatic feats that seem impossible. There's also the mesmerizing sight of snake charmers, who bring live snakes into the arena, showcasing their delicate and seemingly dangerous skills. And of course, no circus is complete without the comedic relief of clowns, who don exaggerated costumes and perform humorous skits, spreading joy to the crowd. In the midst of a changing world, the Rajmoni Circus represents a vibrant link to the past, a reminder of a time when the circus was a source of wonder and joy for people across the country.

Kohli, who scored 9,230 runs in 123 matches at an average of 46.85, posted the decision on Instagram five days after India captain Rohit Sharma called time on his Test career. Since making his debut in 2011, Kohli struck 30 hundreds and 31 fifties with a highest score of 254 not out. ""It's been 14 years since I first wore the baggy blue in Test cricket,"" the 36-year-old Kohli posted on his official feed, which has 271 million followers. ""Honestly, I never imagined the journey this format would take me on. It's tested me, shaped me, and taught me lessons I'll carry for life. ""As I step away from this format, it's not easy -- but it feels right. I've given it everything I had, and it's given me back so much more than I could've hoped for."" An inspirational figure, Kohli was India's most successful Test captains with 40 wins and 17 defeats in 68 matches before stepping down from the role in 2022.  The next best are Mahendra Singh Dhoni with 27 wins from 60 and Sourav Ganguly with 21 from 49. ""I'm walking away with a heart full of gratitude -- for the game, for the people I shared the field with, and for every single person who made me feel seen along the way. ""I'll always look back at my Test career with a smile."" Kohli's lack of form in the five-day game may have been behind his decision to call it a day.  After averaging close to 55 at his peak between 2011 and 2019, the figure dropped to 32.56 over the past 24 months. Kohli's last Test was in Sydney in January when India lost the match and with it the series 3-1 to Australia. Apart from an unbeaten century in the second innings of the first Test in Perth, Kohli managed just 90 runs from eight innings in the five-Test series. The 36-year-old Kohli was part of the ""Fab Four"" quartet of batting greats who dominated Test cricket over the past decade, alongside Steve Smith of Australia, Kane Williamson of New Zealand and Joe Root of England. Nicknamed ""King Kohli"", he was India's batting backbone across three international formats and ended his Twenty20 career with a match-winning innings in his team's World Cup final victory in Barbados last year. Kohli then walked away from the shortest format along with Rohit.",NA

Kylian Mbappe scored a hat-trick for Madrid but Raphinha's double and goals from Lamine Yamal and Eric Garcia gave Barcelona a seven-point lead on the reigning champions with three matches remaining. Hansi Flick's side were knocked out of the Champions League in the semi-finals by Inter Milan on Tuesday and risked their season collapsing if they were beaten by Madrid, but they resisted after Mbappe's early brace. Barcelona battled back to claim a fourth Clasico victory from four meetings this season, showing their dominance over Carlo Ancelotti's side. ""We've opened up an important gap, it was key to win this game after the Champions League (defeat), the fans have forgotten it and so have we, let's enjoy this,"" Yamal told Movistar. ""It was important to win today to bring the league title closer and it went very well, we're very happy."" Real Madrid had made the perfect start to what is expected to be the Italian coach's final Clasico at the helm. Mbappe earned a penalty when he was scythed down by Barcelona goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny, although the Catalans complained in vain the French forward was offside in the build-up. The striker beat Szczesny, who dived the right way and got his fingers to it, but could not keep it out. In the 14th minute Mbappe doubled Madrid's advantage with a lethal finish after Vinicius Junior played him through, with Barcelona complaining again about a perceived foul on Yamal earlier in the move. It was his 26th La Liga strike, taking him past Barcelona's Robert Lewandowski on 25 at the top of the scoring charts, and his 38th of the season across all competitions, beating Ivan Zamorano's club record of 37 in a first season with Los Blancos. Just as they have done on so many occasions this season, Flick's spirited young Barcelona fought their way back in front with a stirring comeback. Thibaut Courtois tipped Gerard Martin's drive over, and from the corner Garcia headed home Ferran Torres' flick-on. Torres flicked wide from close range with an improvised effort and Fede Valverde was booked for a crunching tackle on whirlwind teenager Yamal. Madrid could not stop the 17-year-old star from levelling with a cultured bending effort beyond Courtois after Torres laid the ball off to him in the box. Two minutes later, Raphinha sent Barca ahead, with Pedri threading a pass through for the Brazilian winger to drill home. Raphinha headed over from a brilliant Yamal cross with the outside of his boot, something of a trademark for the Spain international. Mbappe thought he had won another penalty when he fell under pressure from Frenkie de Jong but VAR revealed an offside in the build-up. Moments later, Raphinha netted his second, picking Lucas Vazquez's pocket on the edge of the area, exchanging passes with Torres and beating Courtois. Mbappe netted from an offside position before the break, bringing a rollercoaster first half to a close. Yamal had a goal ruled out for offside early in the second half as Barcelona looked to put their arch-rivals to the sword. Flick brought on Alejandro Balde and Andreas Christensen, with the latter cutting out a dangerous ball as Vinicius looked for Mbappe. Next time around the Brazilian found his man, with Mbappe slotting home his hat-trick as he and Vinicius broke in behind Barca's high line. Barcelona appealed for a penalty when Aurelien Tchouameni blocked Torres' shot with his arm, but after watching the incident again the referee decided not to award a penalty. Real Madrid substitute Victor Munoz might have levelled late on but fired high and wide when sent through, and Szczesny denied Mbappe, who had another strike ruled out for offside. Barcelona thought they had wrapped up their win with a superb Fermin Lopez solo effort but it was harshly disallowed for handball against the midfielder. Madrid had no time left to fight back though, and Barcelona, who last won the league in 2023, could seal the title as early as Wednesday, should Los Blancos stumble against Mallorca.",NA

Pep Guardiola's men were expected to waltz to three points on England's south coast and pull level with second-placed Arsenal on 67 points. But although they dominated possession, they could not break the deadlock, despite the return to action of Erling Haaland. The point for Southampton takes them to 12 for the season, meaning they have avoided the tag of being the joint-worst team in Premier League history. They are now one point clear of Derby's tally of 11 in the 2007/08 campaign. Despite the draw, third-placed City remain well-placed to finish in the top five, which would secure qualification for the Champions League next season. With two games to play they are four points clear of sixth-placed Nottingham Forest, though their rivals all have a game in hand. City's title defence came off the rails in November and December during a season that Guardiola has admitted has been the toughest of his 16-year managerial career. The away side dominated possession at St Mary's Stadium and had 26 shots but managed just five on target during a frustrating afternoon. Saints had picked up just two points out of a possible 33 in their previous 11 games and were given little chance of getting anything from the match. Brentford beat already relegated Ipswich Town 1-0 for their fourth straight win, climbing to eighth in the table, which may be enough for European football next season. Kevin Schade headed home from Bryan Mbeumo's corner in the 18th minute for his 11th Premier League goal of the season. Brighton, also chasing European football, beat Wolverhampton Wanderers 2-0 at Molineux and are behind Brentford only on goal difference. Danny Welbeck scored a first-half penalty and Brajan Gruda added a second in the 85th minute to secure the three points. Everton went into their match on a poor run of form following a sharp uptick when David Moyes returned to manage the club but they have long reached safety in the top flight. Raul Jimenez put mid-table Fulham ahead at Craven Cottage but Vitalii Mykolenko levelled on the stroke of half-time. Two second-half goals in three minutes from Michael Keane and Beto made it 3-1. Aston Villa travel to Bournemouth in the Saturday evening kick-off, still dreaming of securing a Champions League spot for next season. Fourth-placed Newcastle United host Chelsea, a place below them, Sunday, with Forest in action against relegated Leicester City. Champions Liverpool play Arsenal, who are not yet certain of finishing in the top five despite being the closest challengers to Arne Slot's men this season.

There is also a hint of this in the trailer of 'Gulmohar'. The series attempts to bring back a character and present social reality to the audience through his eyes. A rumor is doing the rounds on social media about the 'Gulmohar' series and Syed Ahmed Shawki. 'Gulmohar' is Shawki's largest-scale work as a director so far. The director has admitted the truth of this statement. But how can it be understood that it is a large-scale work? Explaining, Shawki said, ""In the case of fiction, large-scale work can depend on production design. 'Gulmohar' is such a fiction. However, when I say large-scale, I give the most importance to character design."" Shawki said, ""I have previously told the story of a single protagonist. But in the 'Gulmohar' series, there are many characters. Each character has different characteristics, different crises, different layers, different levels. It took a long time to write it, and the production design also had to be done on a large scale. So 'Gulmohar' is my largest-scale work."" Sara Zaker plays the role of Siraj's mother, and Intekhab Dinar, Sushama Sarkar, and Mir Naufel Ashrafi Jisan play the roles of siblings. Intekhab Dinar plays the role of the elder brother. He recently returned from abroad. Naturally, Intekhab Dinar's character goes through this personal family crisis. Sushama Sarkar plays the role of the sister, her character's name is Rehnuma. He said, ""'Gulmohar' is another addition to my acting career. Starting from the rehearsals, the entire process was great. Rehnuma or Renu is such a character that when you see her, you feel like she is a very familiar character, and then she becomes a little stranger somewhere. She repeatedly searches for the melody of her family relationship."" Mir Naufel Ashrafi Jisan played the role of Rabi. He said, ""Here, I feel like a family member with everyone else, that was my effort in acting and presence."" The character of Shanta, which is also a language, has been portrayed in the series. This character is played by Sarika Sabah. She said about her character, ""For this character, suffering is easy and love is a burden. I think many will see themselves in the character of Shanta."" Father, husband, son, brother and political leader - the character of Rana is played by Mostafizur Noor Imran. The actor said, ""This character has a legacy and tradition is very important to him. He is very reserved, does not share his thoughts or plans with others and ends up lost in his own thoughts."" Mostafizur Noor Imran said that one has to watch the series to know whether the character is good or bad. For Saswata Chatterjee, this is the first web series in Bangladesh.",NA

After years of waiting fans finally got to see their favorite star shine at the event. Shah Rukh made history by being the first Indian man to walk the red carpet. Khan appeared in an all-black Sabyasachi ensemble. With this year’s theme being ‘Superfine: Tailoring Black Style’ it was a match made in heaven for King Khan’s apparel of choice. He shared ""My little kids were really excited about the Met. I might not have come otherwise, but when Sabya suggested it, they were thrilled. I'm still not sure if that 'wow' meant 'you got invited' or 'you're actually going to pull it off.'"" Bangladeshi photographer Amir Hamja captured SRK's look for New York Times.   Sabyasachi told the New York Times ‘He just said, 'No shoulder pads that make me look like an airplane.' And Shah Rukh added ""I told Sabya I only wear black and white. What he created is exactly what makes me feel comfortable — and that's how it should be."" Even with his extravagant debut Shah Rukh kept true to himself and with humility he joked about the gold details saying “It's a bit rapper” and ""This might be my last Met Gala."" But all in all he left a big impression on both fans and fashion critics.",NA
