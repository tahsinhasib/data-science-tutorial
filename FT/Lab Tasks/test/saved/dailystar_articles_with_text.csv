The revenue authority is considering increasing the tax-free income limit for individual taxpayers to Tk 375,000, up from the current Tk 350,000, according to finance ministry officials familiar with the matter. The proposal is expected to be presented to Finance Adviser Salehuddin Ahmed on May 15. Then it will be forwarded to Chief Adviser Professor Muhammad Yunus on May 19 as part of the national budget preparation for the fiscal year (FY) 2025-26. The finance adviser is likely to announce the budget on June 2. ""We are considering these measures to provide some relief at the individual level amid stubbornly high inflation over the past couple of years,"" said a senior finance ministry official, requesting anonymity. Over 9 percent inflation has been weighing on Bangladesh for the past 26 months, significantly eroding real incomes. In April, the inflation rate stood at 9.17 percent, according to the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (BBS). In the fiscal year 2023-24, the government increased the tax-free income limit by Tk 50,000 from Tk 300,000. Given the ongoing cost-of-living crisis, economists and business groups have repeatedly called for a revision of the tax-free income threshold. In March, the Centre for Policy Dialogue (CPD) recommended increasing the cap by Tk 50,000, while the Federation of Bangladesh Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FBCCI) urged the government to raise it to Tk 450,000. Other business associations have echoed these calls, arguing that the current threshold no longer aligns with economic realities. In addition to raising the tax-free income limit, the government is also considering easing the requirement to submit proof of income tax return filings for purchasing savings certificates. Currently, individuals investing more than Tk 5 lakh in savings instruments must provide proof of the previous year's tax return. According to officials, the investment threshold could be doubled to Tk 10 lakh to facilitate investments, particularly for low- and middle-income earners. Currently, proof of return filings is required to avail of as many as 45 public and private services. The National Board of Revenue (NBR) introduced the provision of submitting return filing documents for those services to increase tax compliance. However, under the proposed changes, the NBR may relax the proof of return requirement for businesses obtaining licences for the first time, although it could still be mandatory for renewals. Meanwhile, the government is unlikely to extend tax exemptions and reduced rates for businesses in the upcoming budget, as part of conditions tied to the ongoing $4.7 billion loan from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and efforts to boost revenue collection. Revenue officials suggest the rollback of exemptions will be phased, with some being allowed to expire and others curtailed through statutory orders. For instance, a tax break granted to textile exporters in 2022 is set to expire this June and is unlikely to be renewed. However, the readymade garment sector is expected to retain its reduced corporate tax rate until 2028 under a sunset clause. Other sectors currently enjoying lower tax rates, such as jute, small textile mills, poultry and fisheries, could face gradual increases, with rates currently ranging between 5–15 percent. Fahmida Khatun, executive director at CPD, welcomed the proposal to raise the tax-free income threshold and increase the savings certificate investment limit. ""Although we recommended raising the ceiling to Tk 4 lakh, this is at least a positive step amid the ongoing high inflation,"" she said. However, she acknowledged the government's fiscal constraints and emphasised widening the tax net and reducing tax evasion. According to the NBR, around 16 lakh taxpayers filed their returns online this year. Yet, nearly two-thirds of them submitted zero returns, while about 65 percent of Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) holders did not file returns, despite there being around 1.13 crore TIN holders. ""Many people avoid paying taxes, either due to apathy or a tendency to evade taxes,"" Fahmida said. ""Some are concerned about how their money is spent or whether it's being wasted."" ""In this context, it is the government's responsibility to address taxpayers' apathy by ensuring the efficient use of public funds and delivering visible, quality services in return,"" she added. ‘ব্যক্তিপর্যায়ে কিছুটা স্বস্তি দিতে এসব ব্যবস্থা বিবেচনা করা হচ্ছে।’",2025-05-13T00:00:00+06:00
https://www.thedailystar.net/news/bangladesh/news/the-monsters-we-make-3893466,The monsters we make,https://www.thedailystar.net/news/bangladesh/news/the-monsters-we-make-3893466,"On 10 May, a man named Nehal Ahmed Jihad brutally assaulted two women with a belt in full public view at the Munshiganj river terminal. The crowd did not intervene, help the girls or stop him. Instead, they cheered, clapped, and filmed the incident. Some could even be heard screaming, ""That's what they deserve!"" Disturbing? Extremely. But what forced me to look deeper was Jihad's vile justification afterwards: ""I did that to discipline them, as their elder brother."" It made me wonder. What kind of family did he grow up in? Does he truly believe that's what elder brothers are supposed to do? Do they beat their women like this? Jihad's warped reasoning, cloaked in a twisted sense of familial duty, exposes how such poisonous beliefs are passed down through generations. Abuse is normalised under the guise of protection, authority, and ""discipline"". And the silence -- or worse, the applause -- of the bystanders that day speaks volumes about the society we live in. When a woman is beaten in broad daylight and the reaction is applause, not outrage, what does that say about the moral fabric of our nation? Such acts of violence are the inevitable outcome of a society poisoned by patriarchy, misogyny, and deep-rooted inequality. Across South Asia, gender-based violence remains alarmingly prevalent. UN Women reports that the proportion of women in Asia and the Pacific who have experienced physical or sexual violence by an intimate partner is substantially higher than the global average. In Bangladesh alone, 47 percent of married girls aged 15–19 who have suffered violence, did so at the hands of their own husbands or partners. Let that sink in. Nearly half of our young girls -- barely out of childhood -- are being brutalised in the name of ""discipline"", or whatever it is, by the very men who claim to ""protect them"". And what happens next? The children born into these households grow up watching this horror unfold every day. Violence becomes normalised. It becomes a part of their upbringing. According to UNICEF South Asia, exposure to violence during childhood significantly increases the likelihood of violent behaviour in adulthood. In Afghanistan, 74 percent children aged 2–14 have experienced some form of violent discipline. But is Bangladesh very different? The Harvard Centre on the Developing Child explains that early exposure to ""toxic stress"" can disrupt brain development, impairing a child's ability to regulate emotions or control impulses. These children are far more likely to lash out, to grow up angry, broken, and yes, violent. And when those developmental wounds go untreated and are compounded by a society that teaches boys to be dominant and girls to be submissive, the result is exactly what we saw in Munshiganj. Rage, directed at women. Violence, disguised as discipline. Patriarchy, masquerading as family values. So, when do we finally say enough is enough? When do we stop this madness at the root? When will Bangladesh take childhood trauma seriously? How many more girls must be beaten, raped, or killed before we recognise that the seeds of this crisis are planted in the earliest years of life? Will we continue to raise boys on a diet of dominance and entitlement and then act surprised when they grow up to abuse the women around them? This link between early trauma and adult violence underscores the critical need to act. Children who grow up in violent homes are more likely to use violence themselves, more so because they don't know any other way. If we don't intervene, if we don't give them tools to heal, then we're not just failing them, we're perpetuating the very cycle we claim to condemn. Organisations like the International Centre for Research on Women and MenEngage South Asia are doing the work many governments should be leading. They engage men and boys, challenge toxic masculinity, and try to build a future where gender justice is more than a buzzword. But what about us, our society? Are we even ready to have these conversations? Or are we still too busy blaming women for the violence committed against them? The incident involving Jihad is not an anomaly; it is a symptom of a festering disease. Unless we are willing to confront this disease at every level -- within our families, our schools, our courts, and our religious spaces -- we will continue to bury our daughters and sisters under the weight of our inaction. So, I ask again: Will change ever truly come to Bangladesh? Or will we remain a nation where women are beaten in public while people cheer? Will we keep raising boys to believe violence is their birthright? Or will we finally teach them that true strength lies in compassion, not control? ‘ব্যক্তিপর্যায়ে কিছুটা স্বস্তি দিতে এসব ব্যবস্থা বিবেচনা করা হচ্ছে।’",2025-05-13T10:35:15+06:00

https://www.thedailystar.net/opinion/views/macro-mirror/news/the-upcoming-budget-should-deliver-economic-stability-3893041,The upcoming budget should deliver economic stability,https://www.thedailystar.net/opinion/views/macro-mirror/news/the-upcoming-budget-should-deliver-economic-stability-3893041,"As Bangladesh approaches the fiscal year (FY) 2025-26, the country stands at a critical juncture. The interim government is set to unveil a new national budget, which is expected to reflect both the pressing need for economic stabilisation and structural reform. With the economy grappling with high inflation, low revenue mobilisation, rising unemployment, persistent inequality, and the impending graduation from Least Developed Country (LDC) status, the upcoming budget is poised to address these multifaceted challenges. The formulation of the FY2025-26 budget occurs against a backdrop of significant economic and political upheaval. The ousting of the previous government in August 2024, following mass protests, led to the establishment of an interim administration on August 5, 2025, tasked with steering the country through turbulent times. This is reflected in the World Bank's revised economic growth forecast for Bangladesh which dropped to 3.3 percent growth of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) for FY2024-25, marking the lowest rate in 36 years. This reduction is attributed to high inflation, reduced investment, a weak financial sector, and political instability. As of April 2025, the point-to-point inflation rate stood at 9.17 percent, with a 12-month average of 10.21 percent. Although this reflects a decline from last month's 9.35 percent (point-to-point) and 10.26 percent (12-month average) respectively, inflation is still high, persisting for almost three years now. To combat inflation, the central bank has maintained a tight monetary policy, keeping the policy rate at 10 percent. These economic challenges are compounded by the upcoming graduation from LDC status in 2026, which will result in the loss of various flexibilities, including the loss of preferential market access for Bangladeshi products in developed and some developing country markets and access to finance at flexible terms.  Amid these challenges, exports have shown resilience. Export receipts during October-December 2024 increased by 5.1 percent compared to July-September 2024 and by 20.2 percent compared to October-December 2023. This is due to increased export receipts from readymade garments, jute and jute manufacturers, and fish and shrimps. Despite these gains, the readymade garment sector could face headwinds due to new US tariffs and shifting global demand, potentially impacting future export performance. In a departure from previous expansionary budgets, the interim government plans to present a contractionary budget totalling Tk 7.90 lakh crore for FY2025-26, down from Tk 7.97 lakh crore in the current FY2024-25. This reduction reflects a strategic shift towards fiscal prudence in response to mounting economic pressures. The projected budget deficit is expected to be equivalent to about 4.6 percent of GDP. To finance this deficit, the government plans to rely on a combination of foreign borrowing, bank loans, and savings certificates. Over half of the deficit is expected to be covered by external sources. The government will have to be cautious in bank borrowing as it will increase its debt burden. Besides, funds should be available to the private sector whenever needed. One of the challenges, as in the previous years, will be the financing of the budget from domestic sources as Bangladesh's tax-to-GDP ratio remains one of the lowest globally, which is below 8 percent according to government data. This significantly constrains the government's fiscal capacity. To address this, the National Board of Revenue (NBR) has set a revenue collection target of Tk 4.99 lakh crore for FY2025-26. The government plans to broaden the application of the standard 15 percent value-added tax (VAT) rate and reduce tax exemptions. The government aims to generate additional revenue through new tax measures and administrative improvements. However, for efficient and enhanced tax collection, the government must initiate several reforms. Key initiatives to enhance revenue mobilisation include the separation of tax policy and administration within the NBR to reduce conflicts of interest and improve efficiency. Automation of NBR and skilled human resources are other necessary measures. Without deep reform measures, tax evasion cannot be controlled. Therefore, sufficient resource allocation should be made to enhance the institutional capacity of the NBR.  Controlling inflation should be a top priority for the interim government. The new budget plans to reduce inflation to 6.5 percent by the end of FY2025-26. To achieve this, fiscal and monetary policies must be aligned. Fiscal policy should be designed in a way that ensures adequate allocations are made to priority sectors while pursuing a contractionary fiscal policy. Fiscal prudence should be ensured by avoiding excessive borrowing from the banking sector. To control inflation, the government should also closely monitor markets, investigate market manipulation, and enforce anti-trust laws with a zero-tolerance policy to prevent price gouging and ensure fair competition. The allocation for social safety net should be increased to protect vulnerable people. In the current context, the general population expects a budget that addresses their immediate economic hardships, particularly high inflation and unemployment. There is also a strong desire for increased transparency and accountability in government spending, as well as effective implementation of development projects. The public also expects the government to take decisive action against corruption and inefficiency, which have historically plagued budget execution. The interim government is in an advantageous situation to set an example by raking such action since this government has no electoral compulsion. The FY2025-26 budget presents a critical opportunity for Bangladesh to recalibrate its fiscal policies and lay the groundwork for sustainable economic growth. By focusing on revenue mobilisation, inflation control, and strategic investments in key sectors, the interim government can navigate the current economic challenges and set the stage for a more resilient future. The success of this budget will depend on the government's commitment to transparency, accountability, and the effective implementation of its proposed measures.

https://www.thedailystar.net/opinion/views/news/has-the-reform-drive-lost-its-way-3893031,Has the reform drive lost its way?,https://www.thedailystar.net/opinion/views/news/has-the-reform-drive-lost-its-way-3893031,"Public memory is often short, and public judgement is unforgiving when people begin to sense that their expectations are being slighted. Nine months since the interim government took over, where are we, especially in respect of the ""state repair"" goal proclaimed by the youth-led masses when they toppled the long-entrenched autocratic regime? Responding to the call for ""state repair,"" the interim government appointed various reform commissions and committees on institutions and areas of work of the state, including electoral reforms. However, a bout of amnesia appears to have affected sundry pundits and analysts vocal in the media. The political class, especially the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), the presumptive government in waiting, impatiently demands an early parliamentary election. It forgot that the principal demand voiced during the July uprising was for reforms that would prevent the return of symptoms of fascism in the state and political parties. Political and public amnesia is at work when the record of political parties in power prior to the last regime does not come under as much scrutiny as it could. Similarly, little is said now about how the interim government brought the country back from the brink of a failed state and a meltdown of the economy. At the same time, disaffection about the interim government is widespread. A nationwide survey of more than 10,000 people in February-March this year provides evidence. Among respondents, 55.05 percent said price hikes of daily necessities were badly managed by the interim government, while 58.2 percent felt law and order did not improve enough. Over two-thirds did not see enough signs of progress towards a fair electoral process. They hope a fair election may help meet these expectations. Not to be gainsaid that the Advisory Council, collectively and as individuals, have not been the epitome of efficiency, decisiveness, and coordinated action. For instance, emergency actions, such as pending judicial measures, were not taken in time to seize accounts, cancel passports, and ban the travel abroad of suspects involved in horrendous financial and other crimes, until they managed to empty their accounts, transfer assets in some cases, and many fled the country. The so-called ""syndicates"" that control the supply and import of daily necessities and manipulate the whole-sale markets have not been restrained and no perpetrator has been punished, though the characters are known. Bringing the culprits of repression and killings during the July uprising to book is a matter of emotion and justice for the nation. However, the old ways of handling charges and cases with countless anonymous accused and mindlessly implicating people in murder cases still continue. The Advisory Council has let the political parties construct and control the public narrative on reforms—letting them shift the discourse away from initiating reforms in political, economic, and state institutions to the election and the electoral process. The BNP has projected the election of a national parliament, not necessarily of local bodies or a constituent assembly as first steps, as the panacea for all ills. Chief Adviser Prof Muhammad Yunus has been preaching a message of consensus-building as the precursor to democratic transition. The National Consensus Commission was formed on February 13, and it commenced work on February 15 with a six-month time table. The first phase of the consultation is set to end on May 15. One consensus-building aim is to agree on ""July Proclamation"" as a manifesto of the anti-fascist coalition that may guide Bangladesh's democracy journey. The interim government appears to have put on the back burner the reports of a dozen other commissions, task forces, and committees on various aspects of state functions and institutions. A government installed by a student-led popular movement against discrimination created a deluge of reform commissions, but not one on education. Only a consultative committee on primary education was appointed by the Ministry of Primary and Mass Education; its report was submitted to the chief adviser on February 10. It appears, however, that the top officials lack the enthusiasm for transformative change or are devoid of the imagination to comprehend the significance of the changes proposed. So far, we have seen only partial, fragmented, uncoordinated and slow steps, which are creating a negative momentum. More importantly, there is no overall initiative to address the quality, relevance, and equity in the education sector as a whole with its many sub-sectors, such as school, technical and vocational, tertiary, and madrasa education. Are complexity, sensitivity of issues, and the difficulty of making change in the sector reasons for shying away from dealing with it? The authorities are now busy with firefighting as students, teachers, and other stakeholders boycott classes, lock up buildings, and take to the streets. This reactive approach can only compound the problems down the line. What is the prognosis for reforms, then? Political and higher-level governance recommendations (some 166 items) in six reform reports are the focus of attention of the political parties and the consensus commission. From separate consultations with some 39 large and small political parties or groups, the outlines are emerging of the fault lines on major issues. These range from establishing balance between principal pillars of the government, forming an overseeing constitutional council, designing the local government's role and power, and agreeing on the shape and representation of the legislative bodies. Even the idea of pluralism and rejection of theocracy—the fundamental rationale of a free Bangladesh—have become divisive topics. I doubt that a unanimously agreed July charter will emerge from the consensus dialogue, unless major protagonists are willing to be in a magnanimously compromising mood. The major reform commission proposals, besides the prioritised politics-governance sphere, are unlikely to receive the collective attention of the chief adviser and his team at this juncture. It is a pity, because these areas of reform can, if genuinely pursued, have a greater and longer term impact on the life of citizens and promote the culture and values of a democratic society. Looking ahead and hoping for a positive scenario, Prof Yunus and his team, not ignoring many limitations they face, may concentrate on the following outcomes: * A consensus is to be reached on the process and rules of engagement for constitutional change, rather than the substantive content of the new constitution. This implies election of a constituent assembly, which may be turned into the parliament after the constitution is adopted. Whatever agreement on the content reached now or positions of parties stated clearly would facilitate the work of the constituent assembly. * The Election Commission's structure, capacity, and management should be strengthened; necessary changes in the Public Representation Order have to ensure a fair election, eliminating muscle and money power; and the Election Commission should be provided the budget and administrative support to hold model elections, as promised by Prof Yunus. Public representation regulations should be developed/refined and enforced regarding political parties' internal governance, finance, and reporting of election expenditures. * If Prof Yunus and his team are willing to be resolute and bold, they should hold the local body elections as soon as possible as a trial for a fair and peaceful national election, an exercise in people's participation in genuine democracy, and for improved local public services. * Reform proposals, besides the six under discussion, should be reviewed to identify the recommendations that can be promulgated by ordinance, and should be so promulgated. The respective ministries/agencies should be instructed to begin concerted and systematic implementation steps on these reforms. * In the health sector, a consultative committee should be appointed to examine and guide steps towards implementing the Health Reform Commission's proposals. The committee can be replaced eventually by a permanent statutory health commission as proposed by the commission. * In the education sector, a consultative committee should be formed with sub-committees for sub-sectors to initiate a process of situation analysis and formulating reform proposals, starting with proposing early actions. The consultative committee can be turned into a permanent statutory education commission similar to the proposed health commission. * Given the disappearing external assistance for non-governmental development activities, the interim government should demonstrate its bona fides on citizens' and communities' roles in social/economic development reforms. An independently managed trust fund for NGO activities can be established to serve marginalised people. A beginning can be made by allocating a tiny fraction of 0.05 percent of the national budget to this fund, which may amount to approximately Tk 4,000 crore in FY2025-26. Setting aside public amnesia and harsh judgements on the interim government, Prof Yunus and his team need not be too apologetic for their record, given the history of elected and unelected governments over the last 54 years. But it would be a shame not to make the best of the opportunity history has bestowed them.

https://www.thedailystar.net/opinion/views/news/why-we-need-elected-government-soon-3893021,Why we need an elected government soon,https://www.thedailystar.net/opinion/views/news/why-we-need-elected-government-soon-3893021,"In the history of nations, moments arise when the choices made by a people define the trajectory of their collective destiny. Bangladesh now stands at such a critical juncture. The interim government, ushered in amid throes of mass movements and political upheaval, was meant to serve as a temporary custodian of stability—a bridge to democratic restoration. Instead, delays in holding the national election and growing discontent have threatened to turn this fragile bridge into a perilous path. For Bangladesh, the only way forward is through a legitimate, timely, and widely participatory democratic election. Political scientist Samuel P Huntington, known for his incisive works on democracy and political order, once noted, ""The most important political distinction among countries concerns not their form of government but their degree of government."" In other words, legitimacy is not simply conferred by structure, but by people's will. Without democratic elections, Bangladesh's government remains suspended in an uncertain limbo, unable to claim the authority necessary to govern effectively. The aspirations that fuelled Bangladesh's Liberation War in 1971 remain deeply unfulfilled. Two fundamental promises—democratic governance and social justice—have eluded realisation all these years. Mass movements that began as calls for administrative reform have evolved into broader cries for political representation. The chants heard in the streets—""We want democracy""—are not just slogans; they are pleas from a nation yearning for agency. Philosopher John Stuart Mill, one of democracy's staunchest proponents, said the best form of government is one that enables its citizens to ""participate in the management of affairs"" and thereby grow in virtue and intelligence. Bangladesh's current political arrangement, however well-intentioned, denies its people this essential civic experience. By delaying elections, the interim authority deprives citizens of their right to shape their nation's course. While the interim government has attempted some reforms and garnered international sympathy for its efforts, its Achilles' heel is its lack of electoral legitimacy. Political psychologist Seymour Martin Lipset famously argued that ""legitimacy involves the capacity of the system to engender and maintain the belief that existing political institutions are the most appropriate or proper ones."" When that belief erodes, unrest is inevitable. Bangladesh now teeters on such a precipice. Inflation has surged, unemployment festers, and lawlessness permeates the streets. The so-called ""mob culture"" and the rise of juvenile gangs underline a deeper problem: an absence of institutional authority. These are not mere symptoms of economic malaise but signs of political vacuum. Economist Amartya Sen, in his work Development as Freedom, emphasised that political freedoms, including free and fair elections, are not just instruments of development but its constitutive elements. Without elections, development in Bangladesh becomes a house built on sand. Interim administrations are meant to be brief custodians, not long-term stewards. History shows that prolonged transitional governments in developing nations often breed instability, corruption, and even authoritarian regression. The 1/11 crisis of 2007-08 remains a frightening reminder of what can happen when democratic processes are suspended under the guise of reform. Opponents of early elections argue that reform is a prerequisite for meaningful voting. Yet, the converse is equally true: constitutional liberalism without elections is merely an illusion of democracy. Elections do not guarantee perfect governance, but they offer a mechanism for accountability. Elected governments, by their very nature, are more responsive to the needs of their constituents. They have deep-rooted connections to grassroots networks and are bound by the pressure of re-election. An unelected interim regime, however virtuous, lacks the same incentive structure. Bangladesh's economic indicators are already showing stress. Inflationary pressures have eroded purchasing power, while investor confidence continues to wane. Political uncertainty acts as a repellent to both domestic and foreign investment. The World Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF) have both highlighted the importance of political stability in ensuring sustainable economic growth. Without a credible, elected government, Bangladesh risks a slide into economic stagnation. Political scientist Francis Fukuyama, in Political Order and Political Decay, observed that ""modern political institutions are not born fully formed; they are forged through struggle and shaped by context."" For Bangladesh, the struggle now is to consolidate its institutions through a recommitment to electoral democracy. That struggle cannot succeed under a prolonged interim arrangement. Some voices have called for a ""national government"" or an extended caretaker system as a solution to the crisis. But this model, too, is fraught with risk. Such arrangements dilute accountability and blur the lines of responsibility. In developing nations, where democratic culture is still in a formative stage, power-sharing without clear electoral mandates often becomes a recipe for deadlock and dysfunction. Moreover, national governments formed outside the electoral process often become a safe haven for opportunists and power-brokers—political chameleons who switch allegiance for personal gain. The danger is not just theoretical; it has played out in Bangladesh before. When governments form through backroom deals rather than ballot boxes, the people are always the losers. Bangladesh's youth, the lifeblood of its mass movements, have spoken clearly. They demand a future rooted in justice, transparency, and democratic participation. Their voices echo the words of Vaclav Havel, the Czech dissident and later president, who believed that ""the salvation of this human world lies nowhere else than in the human heart, in the human power to reflect, in human meekness, and human responsibility."" To delay elections is to deny people the power to reflect and to choose. The interim government must now do what it was originally tasked to do: create a level playing field for all political actors, initiate essential reforms to ensure a fair election, and hand over power to an elected government. This process must be time-bound, transparent, and inclusive. It must culminate not in vague promises but in a specific date for the election, announced publicly and adhered to. Bangladesh's revolution did not end in 1971—it merely began. The revolution continues in every protest, every slogan, every vote. Let it not be betrayed by political indecision or bureaucratic inertia. In the words of political philosopher Hannah Arendt, ""The most radical revolutionary will become a conservative the day after the revolution."" Let the current leaders not become what they once opposed. Let them lead Bangladesh not back into the shadows, but forward into the light of democratic legitimacy. Only through elections can Bangladesh reclaim its future. The bridge to democracy is not meant to be a destination—but a path. Let us not turn it into a dead end. H.M.

Public demonstrations, student movements, and citizen activism are signs of a politically aware population that wishes to be heard. However, as our society matures, we must improve our self expression methods. Recent protests by students of polytechnic institutes have sparked fresh debate around this issue. Their demands, from administrative changes to curriculum restructuring, are legitimate and deserve attention. Yet, how these protests have come about is deeply concerning. In a series of demonstrations, roads and railways across the country were blocked, bringing entire districts to a standstill. In Dhaka, the already strained traffic system collapsed under the weight of such blockades. While freedom of speech and assembly are protected rights, we must exercise them responsibly. Protests that inconvenience thousands, stranding patients on their way to hospitals, halting emergency services, and making parents miss work and children miss school, cannot be justified under the umbrella of democracy. This is not freedom of speech; it is the imposition of suffering on the innocent. In developing countries like ours, where infrastructure is weak and cities are overburdened, we need a more sensible and structured approach to protests. The idea that roads must be blocked and transport systems must be shut down to make voices heard is outdated and destructive. It emerges from a legacy of authoritarian rule, where public discontent could only be acknowledged through extreme pressure. But now Bangladesh is in a new era, and it's time we left those old habits behind. In many developed democracies, protest is a well-organised affair. In the United Kingdom, Hyde Park's Speakers' Corner is a globally recognised venue for public expression. In the United States, permits are required for large gatherings, and marches are often guided by police to ensure minimum public disruption. In Germany, public squares are designated for rallies, allowing protesters to voice their concerns without paralysing cities. These models show us that it is possible to protest passionately and effectively, without turning daily life into chaos. One of the main issues in Bangladesh is the absence of designated protest zones. The government should urgently consider allocating specific areas in each city, especially in Dhaka, where people can gather, chant, march, and raise slogans without affecting traffic or daily life. These areas can be equipped with basic facilities and proper security so protests can be safe, visible, and impactful. At the same time, institutions and government agencies must be more responsive to citizen complaints and grievances. Creating dedicated ""grievance redressal cells"" within key ministries and organisations can go a long way in restoring public trust. These units should be empowered to receive complaints, acknowledge them, and work towards a resolution within a specified time frame. If people feel that their issues are being taken seriously, the likelihood of disruptive protests will decline. The present government has shown a greater openness to addressing public demands than previous administrations. The swift removal of the Dhaka Polytechnic Institute principal after student protests is a case in point. Such responsiveness is commendable, but it should not be reactive. It must be part of a larger, systemic culture of listening to people before they are forced to resort to demonstrations. Another vital step is public education. Our citizens, especially young people, must be taught the principles of civic engagement and responsible activism. Schools, universities, and community organisations can help instil the values of nonviolent protest, negotiation, and dialogue. Social media, too, can be used as a powerful tool for advocacy. It is equally necessary for law enforcement forces to maintain order. The police must be trained to distinguish between peaceful protesters and those who engage in unlawful acts. Using force should be the last resort and only when public safety is at serious risk. But when roads are blocked for hours, emergency services are halted, and chaos ensues, law enforcement must step in and restore order. As we approach another election season, various protests will likely intensify. Political parties, student groups, and many professional bodies may all take to the streets to make their demands known. But let us make one thing clear: protests that hold an entire city hostage are not a sign of democratic maturity. They are a failure of imagination, a stubborn refusal to find better ways of expressing legitimate discontent. We can and must do better. We must protect our right to protest, but this right should never come at the cost of the common good. We need a national conversation on protest culture, one that involves students, civil society, government officials, and ordinary citizens. Together, we must draft new norms and guidelines that ensure protests are safe, effective, and respectful of everyone's rights. It is time we recognised that the struggle for justice should not involve injustice to others.

https://www.thedailystar.net/opinion/views/news/german-apprenticeship-model-can-transform-our-workforce-3892931,German apprenticeship model can transform our workforce,https://www.thedailystar.net/opinion/views/news/german-apprenticeship-model-can-transform-our-workforce-3892931,"Bangladesh's labour market faces a paradox—while it has a young workforce poised for a demographic dividend, outdated training systems leave many unprepared for the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR). With 65 percent of the population in the working-age group, unemployment is rising, affecting around 24 lakh people, including 19.4 lakh youth. Nearly one-third of the unemployed hold higher education degrees, and unemployment is higher among highly educated women. Despite efforts by the Bangladesh Technical Education Board (BTEB) and the National Skills Development Authority (NSDA) to expand technical and vocational education and training (TVET), systemic challenges persist. Many graduates lack hands-on experience, and outdated apprenticeships hinder industry alignment. Employers prioritise experienced workers over TVET graduates, valuing practical exposure over formal qualifications. Without standardised training, workers lack advanced skills, hindering innovation and limiting industries from meeting international standards and driving growth. Bangladesh's informal skilling system, based on apprenticeships, lacks formal validation and theoretical knowledge, limiting career growth. Institutes emphasise theory over practice, and outdated equipment hampers skill development. Low TVET perception and limited outreach deter students, while ad hoc training reduces adaptability. Integrating formal and informal systems is crucial for building a workforce ready for the 4IR. Learning from the German model The German dual education model, also known as the dual vocational education and training (VET) system, which combines classroom learning and workplace experience, offers a potential solution for Bangladesh's TVET challenges. By fostering close collaboration between education and industry, this model ensures job readiness, aligns training with market demands, and enhances employer confidence. With 40 percent of Germans graduating from dual VET, the country has a 95 percent employment rate. For Bangladesh, adopting aspects of this model could help bridge the skills gap and prepare workers for the 4IR, boosting employment and economic growth. To implement this system in Bangladesh, key sectors like manufacturing, IT, healthcare, and hospitality should be prioritised. A sector-specific curriculum must combine theoretical knowledge with practical skills that meet modern industry demands. Strong partnerships between educational institutions, the government, and private companies are vital. Businesses should offer apprenticeships, while schools provide theoretical training. A structured recruitment process must evaluate candidates based on both academic qualifications and aptitude. Apprentices should receive both classroom and hands-on training, guided by industry mentors. Regular monitoring and feedback will ensure programme effectiveness, while graduates should receive industry-recognised certifications to improve employability. After a successful pilot phase, the programme can be scaled, expanding into new sectors and forming broader partnerships. Continuous refinement of curricula and training methods will keep the programme aligned with evolving industry needs. The German dual VET system succeeds through collaboration. The government supplies skilled labour, reducing youth unemployment. Employers gain a tailored workforce, and vocational schools align curricula with industry demands. Society benefits from economic stability, innovation, and reduced unemployment, making dual VET a cornerstone of Germany's labour market success. Bangladesh can replicate this success to harness its youth potential and ensure sustainable economic growth. The stakes are clear: capitalise on this demographic advantage, or risk squandering it. A robust VET system is key for Bangladesh to tackle unemployment and tap into its youth potential. By aligning education with industry needs, prioritising hands-on training and soft skills, and fostering collaboration, a dual VET model can build a skilled workforce, ensuring sustainable growth and long-term economic stability. Training youth in the dual VET system may seem costly, but current skill development programmes often produce only semi-skilled workers, leading to high dropout rates. Institute-based training lacks real-world exposure, leaving graduates unprepared for industry demands. Despite years of investment, skilled worker shortages persist. Prioritising education is vital for national development. Implementing modern teaching methods, active learning, learner feedback systems, and soft skills development is crucial for Bangladesh's economic growth. Investments in education are a priority to build up any developing nation, and most importantly, implementing modern practices in teaching, learning, and assessment through active learning in the classroom, creating a system for learner feedback and inclusion of higher-order cognitive skills and development of soft skills in the curricula is crucial.

https://www.thedailystar.net/opinion/editorial/news/let-budget-mark-break-the-past-3892676,Let this budget mark a break from the past,https://www.thedailystar.net/opinion/editorial/news/let-budget-mark-break-the-past-3892676,"As the nation prepares for its first budget following the uprising, likely to be unveiled within a month, the latest findings from the International Budget Partnership's Open Budget Survey should serve as a wake-up call for the interim government. Bangladesh continues to languish near the bottom of global lists on budget transparency—ranking 37th among 125 countries in 2023, and trailing behind most of our South Asian peers, according to the survey. This confirms what we have long known: the persistent lack of openness and accountability in fiscal governance under the Awami League and previous governments, particularly in the formulation and implementation of budgets. In fact, the whole process of budgeting, starting from the very onset, has been plagued by a top-down approach, with very limited public participation and almost ceremonial legislative engagement. For instance, while many countries publish pre-budget statements—outlining the broad parameters of fiscal policies, economic forecast, and anticipated revenue, expenditures, and debt levels—to encourage discussion, Bangladesh does not do so. Moreover, recommendations from experts are seldom reflected in the proposed or approved budgets, rendering public consultation and any parliamentary discussion futile. Equally alarmingly, important materials that can help guide public debate—such as simplified budget summaries, monthly implementation reports, and audit reviews—are either missing or delayed. This trend is deeply problematic. In the absence of meaningful public participation in the decisions affecting their lives—such as which taxes to levy, which services to provide, or how much debt to take on—the whole process becomes authoritarian. The lack of transparency and accountability inevitably fuels inefficiency, waste, and corruption. The question is, how can we expect people to pay taxes faithfully when they do not properly know where their money is going—having had little engagement or impact in the budgeting process—or worse, when they suspect that it is being misused? We must not let this trend continue. The interim government has a chance to demonstrate a clear break from the past, setting the ground for greater budget transparency from future political governments. It must begin by publishing a pre-budget statement to initiate public discussion, and ensure public opinion is properly reflected in eventual decisions. The authorities should also strive to adhere to global best practices at every stage of this crucial public matter. ‘ব্যক্তিপর্যায়ে কিছুটা স্বস্তি দিতে এসব ব্যবস্থা বিবেচনা করা হচ্ছে।’",2025-05-12T10:00:29+06:00

The private lender's net profit rose 47 percent year-on-year to Tk 486.33 crore in the January-March quarter, according to its financial statements. The private lender earlier reported a 73 percent surge in consolidated profit to Tk 1,431.84 crore in 2024. Its consolidated earnings per share (EPS) stood at Tk 2.27 for the January-March quarter of 2025, up from Tk 1.54 (restated) in the same period of 2024. The bank said the increase in EPS was primarily due to higher profits generated in the quarter under review. Its net operating cash flows per share rose to Tk 54.40 in the first quarter of 2025 from Tk 30.84 (restated) a year ago. The bank attributed the growth to increased deposit mobilisation and bank borrowings, while loan portfolio expansion was comparatively lower. BRAC Bank also said its net asset value per share increased year-on-year, driven by a rise in net profit and a higher revaluation reserve on government securities. As of March 31, 2025, sponsors and directors held 46.17 percent of the bank's shares. Institutions owned 14.24 percent, foreign investors 31.97 percent, and the general public 7.62 percent. ‘ব্যক্তিপর্যায়ে কিছুটা স্বস্তি দিতে এসব ব্যবস্থা বিবেচনা করা হচ্ছে।’",2025-05-13T12:40:11+06:00

The companies facing regulatory scrutiny are Baira Life Insurance Company Limited, Fareast Islami Life Insurance Company Limited, Sunlife Insurance Company Limited, Sunflower Life Insurance Company Limited, Padma Islami Life Insurance Limited, and Golden Life Insurance Limited. Among them, only Fareast and Sunflower have complied. The deadline passed over two weeks ago. Golden has sought two months, and a meeting is scheduled to be held today with Idra, Saifunnahar Sumi, consultant for media and communication of the regulator, told The Daily Star yesterday. Letters have been sent to Sunlife and Padma reminding them of the directive, she said. The plans were sought by the Idra through letters sent at the end of March this year. The regulator's move aims to ensure greater accountability and protect consumer rights in the sector. Data from the Idra showed that the six life insurers need to settle more than 9 lakh policyholders' claims worth Tk 2,887 crore. The unsettled claims accumulated over five years until the third quarter of 2024 are 98.37 percent of the total claims during this period. According to the latest Idra data, except for Sunlife, the remaining five companies have a claim settlement ratio of less than 5 percent. At present, Bangladesh has 36 life insurance companies and 46 non-life insurers. ‘ব্যক্তিপর্যায়ে কিছুটা স্বস্তি দিতে এসব ব্যবস্থা বিবেচনা করা হচ্ছে।’",2025-05-13T11:19:06+06:00

Equity markets across the world rallied with oil and the dollar Monday after the two sides said they would slash most of their eye-watering tit-for-tat levies and hold talks to end a standoff that has stoked recession fears. The news raised hopes that deals can be done with Washington to cut or even remove some of the tolls unveiled by Donald Trump on his ""Liberation Day"" on April 2 that sent shivers through trading floors and raised concerns about the global trading system. Top-level negotiators said after two days of talks in Geneva at the weekend that the United States would reduce its 145 percent duties on China to 30 percent for 90 days, while Beijing would cut its retaliatory measures to 10 percent from 125 percent. The US president described the move as a ""total reset"" and said talks with counterpart Xi Jinping could soon follow, while US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told CNBC he expected officials would meet again in the coming weeks to reach ""a more fulsome agreement"". After piling higher on the news Monday, most of Asia's markets started Tuesday on the front foot. Tokyo was up more than one percent with Taipei, while Shanghai, Sydney, Singapore, Seoul, Wellington and Manila were also well up. However, Hong Kong dropped more than one percent, having surged three percent the day before. Oil prices and the dollar also pulled back from the previous day's rally. The broad gains in Asia came after Wall Street greeted the announcement with open arms. The tech-heavy Nasdaq rocketed more than four percent, the S&P 500 jumped 3.3 percent and the Dow 2.8 percent, while a gauge of US-listed Chinese stocks surged more than five percent. ""Clearly, US-China trade talks have yielded much faster success than many had expected,"" strategists at HSBC wrote in a note. ""There's very clearly upside risk for the broader risk asset spectrum now as markets will likely extrapolate a higher likelihood of further deals in the coming weeks."" However, nervousness remains. The HSBC strategists added: ""These may not move in a straight line. Things could easily turn out a bit bumpier in future trade negotiations."" And IG chief market analyst said the talks show ""both sides are aware of the need to repair their relationship, and avoid further damage from the imposition of such huge tariffs"". ""But even at the pause levels of 10 percent and 30 percent, these tariffs are still much higher than anything imagined by investors just a few months ago. ""It is not quite six weeks since these tariffs were introduced -- the impact has yet to really appear in both economic data and company earnings. The full impact will only become clear with time."" Meanwhile, Federal Reserve governor Adriana Kugler warned that even with the reduction in tariffs, Trump's trade policies will likely push inflation higher and weigh on economic growth. ‘ব্যক্তিপর্যায়ে কিছুটা স্বস্তি দিতে এসব ব্যবস্থা বিবেচনা করা হচ্ছে।’",2025-05-13T11:26:39+06:00

President Xi Jinping delivered a speech to kick off a ministerial meeting of the China-CELAC Forum, a platform for cooperation between China and Latin American and Caribbean nations. The credit line, denominated in yuan, appears a push to further internationalise the Chinese currency, as China doubles down on deepening strategic and economic ties with the Latin American region. During the inaugural China-CELAC Forum in 2015, Beijing offered $20 billion in credit to be used to help Chinese enterprises invest in infrastructure projects across the continent. ""China is doing a lot more yuan-based deals like this, particularly credit swap agreements that make it easier for the borrowing country to transact in RMB rather than USD,"" said Eric Orlander, co-founder of the China-Global South Project. China will also implement a visa-free policy for five Latin American and Caribbean countries, Xi said without detailing which countries they were. The visa-free policy will be expanded to cover more countries in due course. Trade between China and Latin America exceeded $500 billion for the first time last year, Xi said. That was up from the $450 billion in 2023, and China's trade with Latin America has surged multifold from $12 billion in 2000. Xi told Latin American and Caribbean officials it was a great pleasure to have ""old and new"" friends gather, and reinforced that China supports Latin America and the Caribbean nations to expand their influence in the multilateral arena. The China-CELAC forum has been a vehicle to deepen dialogue between China and the bloc over trade, investment and infrastructure cooperation under China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). ‘ব্যক্তিপর্যায়ে কিছুটা স্বস্তি দিতে এসব ব্যবস্থা বিবেচনা করা হচ্ছে।’",2025-05-13T10:28:54+06:00

While the abrupt decline raises concern, drug makers say the sector's overall performance is positive.  Between July 2024 and April 2025, pharmaceutical exports reached $177.42 million, up from $171.49 million in the same period the previous year. Industry insiders say the April decline should not be seen as a sign of long-term weakness, pointing instead to temporary disruptions.  These short-term export hiccups include port delays, paused orders from Cambodia and Vietnam during their holiday seasons in early 2025, and fiscal tightening in the United States and the United Kingdom.   ""The April figures are worrying, but the broader trend is still positive,"" said Mohammad Ali Nawaz, chief financial officer of Beximco Pharmaceuticals. ""Our export growth remains steady,"" he added.  Although unable to identify the exact cause of the April drop, Nawaz ruled out any link to recent US tariffs imposed under the Trump administration. Other exporters cited supply chain delays, deferred donor-funded purchases, and weaker demand in African and Latin American markets.  Incepta Pharmaceuticals was among the hardest hit after USAID suspended medicine procurement following a funding cut to the US aid agency. ""Since February, the funding cuts have severely disrupted our supply chain. We had to cancel two major vaccine shipments,"" said Incepta's Executive Director Arefin Ahmed.  He noted that USAID previously bought medicines worth at least Tk 10 crore per month. ""They were a consistent and reliable buyer,"" he said, expressing frustration over the sudden loss of a key client. The disruption has not only affected revenues but also hampered Incepta's ability to meet its commitments to supply essential medicines to several countries, including Bangladesh, he added. Despite the sector's decline in April, Square Pharmaceuticals reported strong overseas demand. ""Our export orders are holding up well. We are seeing good traction internationally,"" said Zahangir Alam, chief financial officer of Square Pharmaceuticals. However, he admitted he was unsure why the wider industry saw a downturn in April. ""I have no idea why the industry saw a decline."" Monjurul Alam, CEO of Beacon Medicare, a subsidiary of Beacon Pharmaceuticals, urged caution in interpreting the April data. ""Exports often slow early in the year, especially when ASEAN markets halt orders during holidays,"" he said. ""Shipments are actually increasing. This is just a seasonal dip.""  He predicted a rebound as paused markets resume orders. ""One or two months of lower shipments shouldn't be a cause for concern."" While Bangladesh's pharmaceutical export volumes are meagre in global terms, Alam emphasised the sector's value in enhancing the country's international image and industrial reputation. ‘ব্যক্তিপর্যায়ে কিছুটা স্বস্তি দিতে এসব ব্যবস্থা বিবেচনা করা হচ্ছে।’",2025-05-13T00:00:00+06:00

The Twenty20 tournament was suspended last Friday amid the worst fighting between India and Pakistan in nearly three decades before a ceasefire was reached over the weekend. India's board (BCCI) said on Monday the remaining 17 games would resume from May 17 with the final rescheduled for June 3. That would leave some Australian players like Pat Cummins, Mitchell Starc and Josh Inglis with a quick turnaround for their World Test Championship (WTC) final against South Africa at Lord's that begins eight days later.

Carlo Ancelotti, the calm commander of Real Madrid's modern-era dominance, officially takes the reins of the Brazil national team, a side hungry for redemption and, above all, their first World Cup title since 2002. Brazil's decision to turn to Ancelotti — the first foreigner to manage the Seleçao in a World Cup — is bold but calculated. Following the dismissal of Dorival Junior in March, after a humiliating 4-1 defeat to arch-rivals Argentina, the pressure has only intensified. Expectations always weigh heavily on Brazil, but with Argentina the reigning champions and Neymar's golden generation on the wane, this feels like a pivotal era. Ancelotti's reputation precedes him — not as a tactical revolutionary, but as a master of man-management and emotional intelligence. His book, Quiet Leadership, is more than just a title — it's a philosophy. Brazil, often volatile in its relationship with managers, may finally have a stabilising figure at the helm. He has managed football's biggest egos and brightest stars at Real Madrid, Chelsea, PSG and Bayern Munich. If there's a man equipped to guide Brazil through turbulence, it's Ancelotti. Brazilian legend Zico once said: ""Ancelotti would be ideal because everyone, including opponents, respects him."" Respect will go a long way in navigating the chaos of Brazilian football politics and the glare of a demanding public. Beyond temperament, Ancelotti arrives with strong ties to Brazil's emerging nucleus. Vinicius Júnior — once inconsistent, now lethal — has thrived under his guidance. Rodrygo and Eder Militao have both blossomed at Madrid, while teenage sensation Endrick is already making waves in Spain. Ancelotti's familiarity with this next generation gives Brazil a rare head start in national team building — often plagued by disjointed transitions. If Neymar, who will be 34 by the time the World Cup arrives, fades from the picture due to injuries, this younger core — guided by a coach they trust — could carry the torch. For Ancelotti himself, this is more than just another challenge — it's legacy-defining. He's the only manager to have won all five of Europe's top leagues. He's lifted the Champions League five times. International football, though, remains uncharted territory. Winning a World Cup with Brazil would complete the puzzle — a crowning achievement that has eluded even the greatest club coaches. Brazil wants to reclaim its crown. Ancelotti wants one final masterpiece. The timing may be perfect.

Australia won the World Test Championship in 2023 after beating India in the final at The Oval. Teenager Sam Konstas was also included in the squad, adding a specialist option for the opener's spot, but media reports in Australia said the team could elevate Marnus Labuschagne from number three. The squad will then embark on a tour of the Caribbean where they will play West Indies in three tests from June 25. A squad for the five Twenty20 internationals that follow will be named at a later date.

Atalanta will compete in Europe's elite club competition for the fifth time since 2019. ""Let's celebrate now, we can't waste time,"" Gasperini told DAZN after securing third spot in Serie A. Atalanta, on 71 points, are seven points above fourth-placed Juventus with two games remaining, which allows the Bergamo side to take a more relaxed approach to their final two fixtures against Genoa and lowly Parma. ""Now it's a beautiful evening, we have two weeks to enjoy this season,"" Gasperini said. ""In the Champions League we finished ninth out of 36 teams, missing direct qualification (to knockout rounds) by one point. For us it was formidable, there will be time and opportunity to think about the rest."" Atalanta went on an 11-game winning streak earlier this season which took them top of the standings in December, but a winless run of four matches dropped them to third place, where they have remained ever since. They then suffered three consecutive defeats starting with a home loss to Inter Milan mid-March, further complicating their title race bid. ""I'm happy because it's a fantastic achievement for Atalanta,"" Gasperini added. ""We've been (competing) with Napoli and Inter Milan for a few weeks but I think this was the highest achievement. ""Having left behind so many strong teams that have made this championship beautiful is a great result, it's been a long season with some fantastic peaks and moments of difficulty from which we have recovered in this final with the decisive sprint."" ‘ব্যক্তিপর্যায়ে কিছুটা স্বস্তি দিতে এসব ব্যবস্থা বিবেচনা করা হচ্ছে।’",2025-05-13T08:25:52+06:00
https://www.thedailystar.net/sports/cricket/news/king-kohlis-test-tale-built-grit-3893371,King Kohli’s Test tale built on grit,https://www.thedailystar.net/sports/cricket/news/king-kohlis-test-tale-built-grit-3893371,"Right after Virat Kohli announced his retirement from Tests yesterday, tributes began to pour in on social media from across the world, as everyone -- from former and current cricketers to his millions of fans -- joined hands to serenade one of the greatest batters the game has ever seen. Among the chorus was former India cricketer and commentator Sanjay Manjrekar, who posted on X: ""Biggest brand of the modern cricket era who gave it all for cricket's oldest format. Test cricket owes that debt to Virat Kohli."" While saying that the format itself ""owes a debt"" to the Indian great is a little superfluous, the sentiment behind the statement holds true, as after a career spanning 123 Tests, 9,230 runs and 30 centuries, Kohli deserves his flowers. Interestingly, however, a Test career that ends with universal applause had begun in a very different manner, with many questioning whether Kohli even belonged in the format and, ironically, one of his biggest naysayers being Manjrekar. ""I would still drop VVS [Laxman] and get Rohit [Sharma] in for next Test. Give Virat [Kohli] one more Test, just to be sure he does not belong here,"" Manjrekar posted on Twitter on January 6, 2012, after India suffered an innings defeat to Australia in Sydney. At that time, Kohli was already a star in the making in white-ball cricket but was yet to prove his mettle in the Test arena. Having debuted in the format in 2011, Kohli by then had batted only 11 times in Tests, made 234 runs in total and averaged a mere 21.27. He had struck a couple of half-centuries but was yet to breach the three-figure mark and failed to impress in the first two Tests of that Australia tour, making 43 runs in four innings. His success in the 50-over format at the same time, where he averaged a shade below 47, made his Test stats seem even bleaker by comparison and prompted many to write him off as a white-ball specialist. Facing such challenges so early in one's career, most would have succumbed -- but not Kohli. In the very next Test in Perth, which India again lost by an innings margin, Kohli was India's most successful batter with knocks of 44 and 75, and in the following Test in Adelaide, he struck his maiden Test century. He finished the series as India's highest run-getter, shutting down all his critics and announcing his arrival in the format. But Kohli's challenges in Test cricket were far from over. Throughout his red-ball career, he faced setbacks but always found a way to fight back. In his first Test tour in England in 2014, he was completely found out in the corridor of uncertainty against James Anderson and company, making just 134 runs in 10 innings, averaging 13.4. When Kohli returned to England with the Test team in 2018, he emerged as the highest run-getter with 593 runs -- 244 runs more than the second-highest scorer, Jos Buttler -- with two centuries and three half-centuries. After the lukewarm tour in Australia in 2011–12, Kohli, captaining for the first time in Tests, plundered 692 runs in a four-Test series against the Aussies in his return to Down Under in 2014–15. Under Kohli, India played bold cricket, always pushed for victories and, arguably, his captaincy set the tone for how India are playing across all formats right now. Kohli was just 770 runs away from joining the elite 10,000-run club in Tests, and even though his form in the format has been on the decline in the last few years, the 36-year-old could have carried on for another year or two and achieved that milestone. At the end of the day, by calling time on his red-ball career now, Kohli set an example. He left Test cricket before Test cricket left him, forcing even his most ardent of critics to acknowledge his greatness. ‘ব্যক্তিপর্যায়ে কিছুটা স্বস্তি দিতে এসব ব্যবস্থা বিবেচনা করা হচ্ছে।’",2025-05-13T08:30:03+06:00

Aiming for an immediate return to the top-flight after last season's relegation, Chris Wilder's side beat City 3-0 in the play-off semi-final second leg at Bramall Lane. Kieffer Moore's first goal since December 21 put the Blades ahead in the first half. Championship Player of the Year Gustavo Hamer and Callum O'Hare netted after the interval as United coasted to a 6-0 aggregate victory. The Blades will face Sunderland or Coventry in the final at Wembley on May 24. Sunderland hold a 2-1 lead heading into their semi-final second leg at the Stadium of Light on Tuesday. ""You've got to enjoy nights like this. It's been an incredibly challenging season for us. To have a night like this at home gives the boys a boost and the recognition they really deserve,"" Wilder said. ""I just spoke to the players and said 'look after yourselves'. But then I thought if I was a player would I have a beer tonight? 100 percent!"" In his second spell with the Blades -- after leading them from League One in 2016 to the Premier League in 2019 -- Wilder is determined to finally end his boyhood club's play-off curse. United have failed to win promotion via the Championship or League One play-offs in nine previous attempts -- the worst record of any English club. ""We'll respect any team that we play in the final. It's a one-off and it'll bring the noise and excitement and everything a Wembley final will bring but we have to get the balance right,"" Wilder said. ""We can't be too emotional and that's going to be the biggest task for the players because they're bound to be excited. There's still a huge challenge ahead of us."" The Yorkshire outfit are also aiming to become the third of last season's three relegated Premier League teams to return to the top-flight after Leeds and Burnley were promoted automatically. The Blades were only the third side in Championship history to reach 90 points and fail to win automatic promotion. - Knockout blow - Sixth-placed City had ended 22 points behind third-placed United in the Championship table. The gulf between the teams was evident when United swept to a 3-0 win in the first leg at Ashton Gate on Thursday after City defender Rob Dickie was controversially sent off for a foul on Moore. Scott Twine tried to spark a historic comeback as the City midfielder fired narrowly wide in the opening moments. United responded through Tom Cannon, whose strike from Moore's lay-off whistled just over. City dominated the first 20 minutes and Jason Knight tested Michael Cooper with a low drive before Nahki Wells's long-range blast was repelled by the United keeper. But Wilder's men steadied the ship after City's barrage and threatened themselves through Harrison Burrows' deflected strike. Wales striker Moore delivered the knockout blow in the 41st minute, rising highest in the six-yard box to head home from a corner, with City keeper Max O'Leary protesting in vain he was blocked off by Cannon. United doubled their lead in the 52nd minute when a clever corner routine climaxed with Hamer's shot taking a wicked deflection off Ross McCrorie as it looped over O'Leary. With Blades fans singing of their impending trip to Wembley, O'Hare kept the party going with a clinical finish from Tyrese Campbell's cross in the 83rd minute. ‘ব্যক্তিপর্যায়ে কিছুটা স্বস্তি দিতে এসব ব্যবস্থা বিবেচনা করা হচ্ছে।’",2025-05-13T08:10:57+06:00

Australia and the Netherlands, the countries with most fatalities in the tragedy, quickly called for Russia to assume responsiblity for the downing and pay damages. The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), based in Montreal, said claims brought by Australia and the Netherlands over the shooting down of Flight MH17 on July 17 of that year were ""well founded in fact and in law."" ""The Russian Federation failed to uphold its obligations under international air law in the 2014 downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH17,"" the agency said in a statement issued Monday evening. The ICAO said this was the first time in its history that its council has made a determination on the merits of a dispute between member states. On July 17, 2014 the Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777 -- en route from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur -- was hit by a Russian-made BUK surface to air missile over eastern Ukraine's Donetsk region, where pro-Russian separatist rebels were battling Ukrainian forces. Dutch nationals accounted for two-thirds of the dead, along with 38 Australians and about 30 Malaysians, with many victims having dual nationalities. Then-Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko called it a ""terrorist act."" Pro-Russian rebels in the area claimed the airliner was shot down by a Ukrainian military jet. Russian President Vladimir Putin said Ukraine ""bears responsibility."" The following day, then US president Barack Obama said a missile fired from separatist-held territory was to blame and the rebels would not have been able to hit the airliner without Russian support. In 2022 a Dutch court sentenced three men to life in prison over the downing, among them two Russians, but Russia refused to extradite them. Russia has consistently denied any involvement in the tragedy. In 2023 a team of international investigators from the Netherlands, Australia, Malaysia, Belgium and Ukraine said there were ""strong indications"" that Putin had approved the supplying of the missile that down the jetliner. Last year investigators suspended their probe of the downing, saying there was not enough evidence to identify more suspects. Ukraine's Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha celebrated the ICAO decision, writing in a statement on X: ""This is one more step toward restoring justice for this crime."" ""And a clear message: no matter how much money and effort Russia put into lying to conceal its crimes, the truth wins out, and justice prevails."" The governments of Australia and the Netherlands also welcomed the UN agency's decision Monday night and pressed for action against Russia. ""This is a historic moment in the pursuit of truth, justice and accountability for the victims of the downing of Flight MH17, and their families and loved ones,"" the Australian government said in a statement. It called on the agency to ""move swiftly to determine remedies"" for Russia's violation of international law. ""We call upon Russia to finally face up to its responsibility for this horrific act of violence and make reparations for its egregious conduct, as required under international law,"" the statement added. Dutch Foreign Minister Caspar Veldkamp said: ""The decision cannot take away their grief and suffering, but it is an important step towards truth-finding, justice and accountability for all victims of flight MH17 and their relatives."" The minister said that in the coming weeks the ICAO council ""will consider the manner in which legal redress should take place."" Australia and the Netherlands want the council to make Russia enter into negotiations with them and to supervise the process, the minister said. ‘ব্যক্তিপর্যায়ে কিছুটা স্বস্তি দিতে এসব ব্যবস্থা বিবেচনা করা হচ্ছে।’",2025-05-13T10:34:05+06:00
https://www.thedailystar.net/my-dhaka/news/why-bijoy-sarani-feels-dhakas-true-heartbeat-3892446,Why Bijoy Sarani feels like Dhaka’s true heartbeat,https://www.thedailystar.net/my-dhaka/news/why-bijoy-sarani-feels-dhakas-true-heartbeat-3892446,"Dhaka doesn't have a city square per se, but places like Shahbagh and areas around Motijheel serve as a sort of one. But in my opinion, the vibrant, colourful pavement adjacent to our Parliament building and the Bijoy Sarani thoroughfare can be a contender in the race to nominate a town square – one designated open space for the public to come and unwind. The atmosphere of this prominent pedestrian area in Dhaka is electrifying, if I am to describe it simply. I was crossing the area last Tuesday, which was a weekday, mind you, and the place was pulsating with activity; I had to stop and soak in the happy energy. Weekends must be extra fun. I am not sure if I can find the correct words to describe the flurry of happenings on that joyful pavement. It was after office hours, and the sun hung low in the sky, emitting a golden orange hue of light. The summer breeze soothed the day's tiredness. For me, it was a picture- perfect Dhaka moment — exactly how I want to see my beloved metro. Groups of young office executives, university students, and friends were engaged in fun banter and serious office discussions, pulling each other's legs, and raucous laughter — just the way young people ought to be: carefree and joyful.  Their jubilant mood seeped into me and other elderly couples lazing in the sun. Young ones in love, mothers and children, and loners seeking me-time – it was a motley crowd. ""I left Dhaka when I was 24. I was a tailor in Saudi Arabia for almost three decades. I have recently returned, and I am enjoying the mood here. When I left, the area around Sangsad Bhaban was barren, but look at it now,"" says Yasin, chewing on a sweet betel leaf he bought from Asma, who was selling cigarettes and paan on that pavement. Asma's makeshift shop was just a cigarette-selling tray, set on top of a wooden stool. She sat on the concrete under a big Bakul tree (Indian Medlar). Her no-nonsense attitude and well-brewed milk tea pull customers to her pop-up stand. ""I have been doing business here for the last eight years. I started the business with my own money, and I earn a decent living. Who is there to stop me from working just because I am a woman in a man's world?"" she answered me when I asked if the men around her accept her presence.  There were quite a few young women selling cupcakes, alongside agar-agar jello with coconut shavings, which seemed to be a new kind of street food. Sitting with a child in her lap, Amena, a young girl, was selling these baked desserts. A young lad with developmental disability was selling ice-chilled fizzy drinks, water, and a traditional yoghurt drink called mattha. Then there was the crowd-pleaser ghoti gorom chanachur, which in exact translated words would mean a street snack of fried and crispy chickpeas, lentils, peanuts, and rice flakes — that are kept hot under a ghoti or pot, which in turn is kept warm with slow-burning wood dust. It is a local treat along with Dhakaiya masala muri with ghunni chaat (puffed rice and chickpeas) and Jhal Muri. The thing that I really appreciated was that the walkway is jammed with young and old independent retailers, hawking their unique items, handcrafted goods, clothing, and food. It is an interesting place to relax and feel upbeat because the ambience there is very chilled. What caught my attention was a teenager with a Boxing Arcade Machine. For just Tk 20, you can test your punching power. He is surrounded by a crowd of young men keen to impress. I must confess, I tried my hand and failed miserably, drawing sympathy from the gathering. Part-timers and freelancers find this public area friendly for brisk business. Ordinary people find it a lively and happening place to loosen up and take a break at the day's end. Next time you are in that vicinity, take the time out to explore the exuberance there. ‘ব্যক্তিপর্যায়ে কিছুটা স্বস্তি দিতে এসব ব্যবস্থা বিবেচনা করা হচ্ছে।’",2025-05-12T00:00:08+06:00

The ceremony was led by artist Rafiqun Nabi. Artist Biren Shome and Dr Farida Zaman, Syeda Fouzia Hossain, chairman of Rivera Group, were also present as the show officially opened to the art lovers, especially the youth. In his speech, Nabi praised the young artists' spirit, remarking, ""The artists are still students, they are still learning, and they have a great zeal to keep going."" He encouraged them to stay rooted in both academic discipline and creative freedom while experimenting with different styles.  ""The showcase is an interesting mix, it is admirable how young women are coming together to show their work,"" remarked Luva Nahid Choudhury, the director general of Bengal Institute. ""The event was clearly more than an exhibition, a celebration of youth, courage, and creative defiance."" The exhibition featured multidisciplinary works by Astha Anindita, Kazi Sadida Bushra, Ramisa Zara Rouf, and Mantaqa Tahiyat -- four women who have nurtured their art practice over the last few years. The exhibition paid homage to Choukaath's core philosophy of the search for creative liberty. ""We created Choukath to be a space where artists can move beyond the marketability of their work and simply enjoy the creative process,"" remarks Anindita, one of the founders of Choukaath. ""We believe in making art for the sake of creation, and we aspire to be the platform that ensures that freedom."" The exhibition featured multidisciplinary works, including pen on ink, charcoal drawings, acrylic, watercolour, etc. The young batch had also worked on installation features, which explored the complex themes of childhood and the search for identity. Being a student at the Department of Media, Communication & Journalism in North South University, Bushra worked with the concepts of mental health, uncertainty and human connections. In her works, such as ""Aftermath"" and ""Dancing Rites,"" jittery strokes echo emotional residue. Her charcoal series on anxiety featured internal conflicts, capturing uneasiness in smudged strokes. Mantaqa, a student of the University of Development, Alternative Department of Fine Arts, considers art as her first language. ""Daini kothon"" (Witch's Tale), ""State of Dismemberment"" were some of her notable works. Her installation captivated the audience as it explored the deep wounds of childhood. Ramisa's collection explored innate creativity, using mediums like ink and watercolour. A graduate of Parsons School of Design (New York), the artist and designer described her process as being driven by intuition and precision. Her pieces included works in linocut print, oil pastel on paper and mixed media on paper. Astha is a student of the Faculty of Fine Arts, Dhaka University. Her works delved into themes of identity and fantasy. Using mixed media, Indian wash techniques, and bright watercolour. ""Identity,"" ""Dwishotta"", and ""Obscure,"" were some of her prominent works that touched on the themes of duality of self in the age of globalisation. ""These are all good works, all very experiential. You can see they're committed,"" commented visitor Sonya Binte Hasan, who is also an artist. The exhibition ran till May 6. ‘ব্যক্তিপর্যায়ে কিছুটা স্বস্তি দিতে এসব ব্যবস্থা বিবেচনা করা হচ্ছে।’",2025-05-10T00:32:30+06:00

However, this year's festival unfolds under the shadow of proposed US tariffs on foreign films, announced by President Donald Trump.  The 100% tariff proposal has sparked concern across the international film community, potentially impacting the distribution of Cannes-selected films in the lucrative US market.  Star-studded red carpet
 Yet again, the festival's red carpet will undoubtedly shine with Hollywood luminaries. Tom Cruise is set to attend the premiere of ""Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning"". Robert De Niro will be honoured with the prestigious Palme d'Or, with Angelina Jolie presenting the award.

Directorial debuts Actors Scarlett Johansson, Kristen Stewart, and Harris Dickinson will make their directorial debuts in the Un Certain Regard section. Johansson's ""Eleanor the Great"", Stewart's ""The Chronology of Water"", and Dickinson's ""Urchin"" will compete, showcasing fresh perspectives from established performers. Focus on Palestine
 The ongoing conflict in Gaza finds a voice at Cannes through several films. Iranian director Sepideh Farsi's documentary ""Put Your Soul on Your Hand and Walk"" tells the story of Gazan photojournalist Fatima Hassouna, who was killed along with ten family members in an Israeli airstrike.  Additionally, ""Once Upon a Time in Gaza"", directed by Arab and Tarzan Nasser, is set to compete in the Un Certain Regard section, highlighting the human cost of the conflict. Intense competition
 This year's competition for the Palme d'Or is fierce, with 22 films vying for the top prize. Notable entries include ""The Young Mothers' Home"" by the Dardenne brothers, ""The History of Sound"" featuring Josh O'Connor, and Iranian director Jafar Panahi's ""It Was Just an Accident"". Themes range from historical dramas to contemporary social issues, reflecting the festival's diverse selection. Bangladesh's historic entry
 Bangladesh marks a milestone with its first official selection at Cannes this year. Adnan Al Rajeev's short film ""Ali"", co-produced by Tanveer Hossain of Bangladesh and Kristine De Leon of the Philippines, is featured in the Short Film section. The 15-minute film's inclusion signifies a growing recognition of Bangladeshi cinema on the international stage.

Farsi welcomed the impact of her film but called on Cannes Festival organisers to denounce Israel's ongoing bombardment of the devastated Palestinian territory. ""There needs to be a real statement,"" she told AFP. ""Saying 'the festival isn't political' makes no sense."" This year's Cannes jury president Juliette Binoche was initially said by organisers to have signed the petition, but her spokeswoman told AFP she had not endorsed it and her name was not published by Liberation. Other signatories include Jonathan Glazer, the British director of Jewish origin who won an Oscar for his 2023 Auschwitz drama ""The Zone of Interest"", as well as US star Mark Ruffalo and Spanish actor Javier Bardem. War programming The Cannes Festival kicks off Tuesday on the French Riviera, with an opening ceremony headlined by Robert De Niro and three films showing the devastation of Russia's war on Ukraine. Two documentaries featuring Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and a third film shot on the brutal frontlines of Europe's biggest war in 80 years are to be screened on a ""Ukraine Day"" of programming. It is ""a reminder of the commitment of artists, authors and journalists to tell the story of this conflict in the heart of Europe"", the festival said. Nothing similar has been planned for the war in Gaza, but the film on Hassouna is set to ""honour"" her memory, organisers have said previously. Gazan filmmakers Arab and Tarzan Nasser are also set to showcase their fiction feature set in 2007 in the Palestinian territory in one of the secondary sections of the festival. The opening film on Tuesday evening is ""Leave One Day"" by newcomer French director Amelie Bonnin, before Hollywood heavyweight De Niro receives an honorary Palme d'Or. The Gerard Depardieu-sized shadow on Cannes De Niro is one of the most outspoken critics of Donald Trump in the American cinema world, with the ""Taxi Driver"" star often struggling to find words harsh enough for the US president. Trump has made himself one of the main talking-points in Cannes after announcing on May 5 that he wanted 100-percent tariffs on movies ""produced in foreign lands"". The idea sent shockwaves through the film world, although few insiders or experts understand how such a policy could be implemented. Cannes director Thierry Fremaux talked up the festival's ""rich"" American film programme on Monday (May 12), with movies from Wes Anderson, Richard Linklater, Ari Aster and Kelly Reichardt in the main competition. ""American cinema remains great cinema. The United States remains a great country of cinema,"" he said. Off-screen news in France is also likely to overshadow the red-carpet action in Cannes today, with French film icon Gerard Depardieu facing a verdict in a sexual harassment case in Paris. Depardieu, who has acted in more than 200 films and television series, is the highest-profile figure caught up in France's response to the #MeToo movement against sexual violence. Tom Cruise in town While independent cinema forms the core of the Cannes festival, organisers also hand over part of the programme to major Hollywood studios to promote their blockbusters. Tom Cruise is set to return to the Riviera for the premiere of the latest instalment of his ""Mission: Impossible"" franchise on Thursday (May 15), three years after he lit up the festival while promoting ""Top Gun: Maverick"". The festival will also see a series of high-profile debut films from actors-turned-directors, including ""Eleanor the Great"" from Scarlett Johansson and ""The Chronology of Water"" by Kristen Stewart. Organisers on Monday (May 12) denied reports that they had banned provocative near-nude dresses from the red carpet. However, ""full nudity on the red carpet"" has been formally outlawed, ""in keeping with French law"". ‘ব্যক্তিপর্যায়ে কিছুটা স্বস্তি দিতে এসব ব্যবস্থা বিবেচনা করা হচ্ছে।’",2025-05-13T11:04:39+06:00

Marisa Abela took home the leading actress award for her standout role in ""Industry"", solidifying her place among the top performers of the year. Meanwhile, Jessica Gunning, whose breakout performance in ""Baby Reindeer"" has already earned her an Emmy and a Golden Globe, added a BAFTA to her growing collection, winning best supporting actress. BBC's powerful drama ""Mr Loverman"" also had a strong night, with Lennie James winning leading actor and Ariyon Bakare taking best supporting actor, further highlighting the show's emotional depth and impact. ITV's critically acclaimed ""Mr. Bates vs The Post Office"" continued its awards momentum, winning in the limited series category and receiving multiple mentions throughout the evening, reflecting its deep resonance with audiences and critics alike. Although ""Rivals"" missed out on a win in its category, the night wasn't without celebration for its lead. Danny Dyer, beloved by fans, won the male performance in a comedy prize for his role in ""Mr Bigstuff"", marking his first BAFTA win. In typical Dyer fashion, his victory speech featured a couple of f-bombs, much to the crowd's delight. The ceremony, hosted by Alan Cumming, kicked off against the backdrop of earlier victories from the BAFTA TV Craft Awards, where ""Baby Reindeer"", ""Slow Horses"", and ""Rivals"" had already each secured two awards. The 2025 BAFTA TV Awards ultimately celebrated a diverse range of stories and talents, reflecting the rich creativity and fearless performances that continue to drive the television industry forward.

For the past few years, Chirkutt had been navigating a period of major changes. Two years ago, guitarist and composer Emon Chowdhury left the group, followed by Jahid Nirob's departure last year. Drummer and music producer Pavel Areen also shifted his focus more toward his solo career.  However, none of it has slowed down Chirkutt's heartbeat. Led by the band's founder and vocalist Sharmin Sultana Sumi, Chirkutt continues to move forward with new members and renewed energy. Nearly two decades into their musical journey, Chirkutt has surprisingly only released three albums so far. Two years ago, they teased fans with the announcement of a new album titled ""Pendulum"".  However, that project evolved into something deeper — and yesterday, the first song from their newly-titled album ""Bhalobashashomogro"" finally dropped.  The track, ""Dami"", is now available with a music video on the band's official YouTube channel. ""Bhalobashashomogro"" features ten tracks in total. Alongside ""Dami"", the album includes songs titled ""Uttore Bhalo Na"", ""Daak"", ""Agun"", ""Hiya"", ""Mon Keno Dilen Na"", ""Oshukh Shere Jay"", ""Bhalobashi Tomay"", ""Dorodi"", and ""Din Jay"".  Three tracks will be released as full-fledged music videos, while the rest will be accompanied by lyrical videos. All songs are set to be released within this week. Speaking about the album's title, Sumi shared, ""From what I have seen of this world, love is the greatest energy. Without love, we have nothing to say, nothing to do. Love should be the language of our songs. That's why we named the album 'Bhalobashashomogro'."" ""Love isn't just about romance; it's universal. Every song reflects a different shade of love. Everyone contributed to the making of this album — after countless discussions, this is what we created,"" she concluded.  At a time when most bands prefer releasing singles rather than full albums to stay afloat in the age of streaming, Chirkutt chose to walk their own path. A full set of ten songs — a bold move these days — is rare. Sumi has heard the questions about it plenty of times. ""People often ask, 'Why release an album now? Why ten songs? Nobody does that anymore.' But honestly, we've never approached music with that kind of overthinking,"" Sumi said.  The singer continued, ""Chirkutt is now 23 years old. When we started, we didn't think about strategy, or whether it would sell. We simply made music out of passion. Whether it was CDs or digital platforms never mattered to us. An album, for us, is a collection of our thoughts, our language. Our music is raw and honest. We've never tried to create 'hits'. We've always rejected typical market concepts — and perhaps that's why Chirkutt's songs have connected with people around the world in such a personal way."" Chirkutt's musical story began with their debut album ""Chirkutnama"" in 2010, followed by ""Jadur Shohor"" in 2013. Their third album, ""Udhao"", was released in 2017. ‘ব্যক্তিপর্যায়ে কিছুটা স্বস্তি দিতে এসব ব্যবস্থা বিবেচনা করা হচ্ছে।’",2025-05-12T15:39:53+06:00

As confirmed by PWInsider, the icon breathed his last on May 11, only weeks after marking his retirement with a final bout against Joey Janela—billed as his farewell match. While the cause of his death has yet to be revealed, reports confirm that Sabu had previously faced serious health concerns.  In 2013, he suffered a medical emergency during the Squared Circle Expo, where he was rushed to hospital after collapsing on the show floor. At the time, Sabu acknowledged the incident through a brief post on Twitter (now X), stating he was recovering and thanking fans for their support, without disclosing further details. Tributes have since poured in across the wrestling community. Fellow ECW star Francine wrote, ""My heart is broken. Rest in peace to my friend Sabu. I love you always.""  Long-time ring partner Rob Van Dam paid homage with a simple finger-pointing emoji, a nod to Sabu's signature ring gesture. Brian Heffron, popularly known as The Blue Meanie, shared, ""Rest In Peace Sabu… Thank you, I love you, I'll miss you… I'm totally devastated.""  WWE star Damian Priest added, ""Rest easy, legend,"" along with a broken heart emoji. Trained by his uncle Ed ""The Sheik"" Farhat, Sabu began his wrestling journey in 1985. He first gained fame in Japan through promotions such as Frontier Martial-Arts Wrestling (FMW) and New Japan Pro Wrestling, before joining ECW in 1993. His return to the franchise later that year led to a five-year run that shaped the hardcore wrestling genre. A three-time World Heavyweight Champion, Sabu will be remembered as one of the most innovative and fearless performers to ever step into the ring. ‘ব্যক্তিপর্যায়ে কিছুটা স্বস্তি দিতে এসব ব্যবস্থা বিবেচনা করা হচ্ছে।’",2025-05-12T09:28:43+06:00

Crafted from pure milk with a time-honoured recipe, it remains a beloved, authentic symbol of the region’s culinary heritage. Photo: Jawwad Sami When you think of Brahmanbaria, one name that immediately comes to mind is its iconic sweet, chhanamukhi. This small, cube-shaped sweetmeat, with light sugar coatings and soft chhana inside, have been winning hearts for nearly 200 years. Its long history and unique taste make it a treasure of the district. The oldest shop in the area, Mahadev Mishtanno Bhandar, located at Mahadev Potti, has been making chhanamukhi for almost 180 years. The story begins with Mahadev Panre, the founder of this famous sweet. He moved from Kashi to Kolkata with his brother, Durga Prasad. There, he began working in his brother's sweet shop and quickly became popular. After his brother's death, Mahadev moved to Brahmanbaria in search of work, where he found shelter at Shibram Modak's sweet shop. When Mahadev arrived, the fame of the shop grew. Before his passing, Shibram passed the shop to Mahadev. As a Brahman who never married, Mahadev later gave the shop to a nearby temple before his death. Today, four generations later, the shop is managed by Narayan Modak, continuing the legacy. The shop's recipe for chhanamukhi has stayed the same throughout the years. It is made with the same care and attention as it was in the beginning. This consistency has helped Mahadev Mishtanno Bhandar retain its reputation as one of the best sweet shops in Brahmanbaria. The shop is surrounded by other confectioneries, many of which are run by the owner's relatives or close acquaintances. While chhanamukhi is the star of the show, Mahadev Mishtanno Bhandar is also known for other specialities including taaler bora, roshmalai, jafran bhog, rajbhog, and ledikeni — a sweet with its own rich history, though it is no longer available. Sujit Madan, an employee working at the shop for 25 years, shares, ""Chhanamukhi is the best seller here. Our taaler bora and roshmalai are also fan favourites."" Gopal Sarkar, the skilled moira (the community known for making sweets) who has also been with the shop for 25 years, explains the process of making Chhanamukhi. He explained that the journey starts with fresh milk collected from village farmers. ""To make chhana, we boil pure milk, and about half an hour later, the curdled milk is separated, placed in a cloth, and tightly tied up to remove excess water. Once the chhana hardens, we cut it into pieces and dip them in sugar syrup,"" Sarkar explains. One kilogram of chhanamukhi costs Tk 700, which reflects the purity and effort involved. Sarkar adds, ""It takes 20 kilograms of milk to produce just 3 kilograms of chhana, which is why the price is high, but what you get is pure as a result."" Mahadev Mishtanno Bhandar is a busy shop, operating from 7 AM to midnight. Despite many shops in the area, this shop continues to stand out as the birthplace of chhanamukhi. Simple yet rich in flavour, it continues to be a timeless favourite, enjoyed by generations. A visit to this iconic shop is a must for anyone wanting to explore the region. An interesting fact about chhanamukhi is that it has received Geographical Indication (GI) status in 2024, which means it is officially recognised as a special item from the region of Brahmanbaria.",2025-05-12T22:19:23+06:00

As temperatures rise, fashion leans into comfort without wanting to let go of elegance. This summer, style is less about making a loud statement and more about thoughtful choices with lighter fabrics, cleaner cuts, and a softer, more personal way of standing out. Whether it is the easy flow of kameez and saree, or the relaxed charm of a panjabi, summer 2025 is about pieces that breathe, move, and quietly command attention. The classic kameez remains a summer staple, but it's the structure and fabric that adds style to it. Think shorter hemlines paired with flared pants, sleeveless or loose full-sleeve designs, and breezy cottons that hold shape but feel weightless. While neutral tones set a safe base, careful pops of embroidery, block prints, and abstract geometric patterns add to the structured look -- a perfect combination for office and outings. Nothing says Bengali perfection like a saree. However, summer demands a certain looseness in how we approach it. Lightweight weaves like muslin, cotton silk, and khadi are the go-to choices. Sarees in solid colours like ivory, lemon yellow, and pale peach look striking and serene when styled with contrasting blouses or even a crisp crop shirt for a modern spin. Handloom textures and patchwork remain at the heart of the trend with subtle borders or embroidered motifs. This season is not about heavy embellishments; it's about breathing life into tradition with lighter, airier versions that can move from daywear to dinner with just a change of accessories. For men, the summer panjabi steps firmly into the spotlight. Gone are the overly formal versions reserved for festivals. Instead, light cottons, linens, and mixed fabrics in soft tones set the tone for everyday wear. Very minimal chikankari work or subtle thread detailing is enough to make a panjabi stand out without feeling weighed down. Paired with slim-fit pyjama trousers, shalwars, or even denims, the look is polished but easy-going. Summer dressing this year is not about how much you can add, but how much you can refine. Accessories are kept to a minimum; a pair of statement silver earrings or a delicate chain around the neck. Sandals or ballet flats complete the look without competing for attention. This summer, with the heat challenging every step of the way, you must give yourself permission to breathe. Choose pieces that make you feel like yourself, even when the sun weighs heavy. Whether you opt for kameez, kurti, saree, shirt or panjabi, make sure your statement speaks softly but clearly. Less noise, more nuance. And always, a quiet kind of cool.   Model: Parinaz

Photo: Hatil Eid-ul-Adha is just around the corner, and while many of us are busy checking off the usual to-do list: finalising the Qurbani budget, stocking up on essentials, and revisiting those cherished family recipes, there are certain important details that often get overlooked until the last minute, like decorating the dining space. This is, after all, the heart of Eid gatherings — the place where dishes are served and memories are made. So, this year, why not give it the attention it deserves and make it truly festive? Start now, and your future self will thank you! Why? Because the curtains will smell like flowers instead of dust, the tablecloth will not feature that suspicious stain, and your fancy cutlery will actually sparkle, rather than giving off accidental ""vintage"" vibes. Knock out these low-key chores first: declutter the cabinets, wash your curtains, polish any wood surfaces, and give the rarely seen tableware its moment. These little changes will make the entire space feel fresh and festive, without denting your wallet. And don't forget the lighting. It plays a surprisingly big role in setting the mood. Swap out harsh overhead lights for softer alternatives. Floor lanterns, fairy lights, or a cluster of candles as a centrepiece can change the atmosphere entirely! For good! Pair this with a few indoor plants in the corners for a touch of nature. These small changes not only highlight your food beautifully, but also create a cosy, inviting environment. Now, let's focus on the dining table itself. The literal centrepiece of your dining room. If you have been contemplating an upgrade or addition, Eid preps might be the perfect excuse to explore options. Love a clean, modern vibe? There are minimalist designs that champion ""less is more"" —like Scandinavian-style rectangular tables with light wood finishes or sleek tempered glass tops that bring an airy, elegant feel to your space. They are not just beautiful — they are practical, especially for smaller dining rooms. But, if you are looking for something with a bit more presence, an ornate table in dark wood or marble can add a touch of luxury and bring a classic, refined feel to your room. They are perfect if you love entertaining or want your dining space to feel a little grand. You may consider adding a sofa or couch in the corner if you have more space. Though space is rare, especially in a city like Dhaka. So, if making room is your major concern, consider extendable tables that grow when guests arrive. Some contemporary sets even include built-in storage, which is perfect for maintaining space. Round tables, on the other hand, foster style, intimacy, and conversation. You can go for them as well. However, if you are concerned about the budget, you do not have to compromise — the furniture brand Hatil is offering 5-10 per cent discounts. They also offer EMI (Equated Monthly Instalment) plans, so you can upgrade your space without paying everything upfront. It's a good way to invest in quality while keeping your budget in check. So, if you have been eyeing that gorgeous table, now is your time to go for it before Eid!",2025-05-12T21:29:57+06:00
https://www.thedailystar.net/life-living/health-fitness/news/perimenopause-and-menopause-understanding-the-hormonal-journey-3892236,Perimenopause and menopause: Understanding the hormonal journey,https://www.thedailystar.net/life-living/health-fitness/news/perimenopause-and-menopause-understanding-the-hormonal-journey-3892236,"Menopause is not a singular event. It is part of a broader continuum of change that begins years before the final menstrual period and continues long after. Understanding this passage, beginning with perimenopause, can turn confusion into clarity, and fear into empowerment. Across Bangladesh and much of the world, women often enter the perimenopausal stage of life with little awareness and even less preparation. Conversations around it are scarce, cloaked in discomfort and cultural silence. Yet this transition — a complex hormonal and emotional shift — touches nearly every aspect of a woman's life, from her physical wellbeing to her psychological stability and sense of identity. ""My sleep was a mess, I kept forgetting things, and my heart would race for no reason. For months, I thought I had an anxiety disorder or early dementia. It never crossed my mind that it could be perimenopause"" Menopause doesn't arrive all at once. Dr Syeda Husna Akhter, Senior Consultant Gynaecology and Obstetrics at Super Specialized Hospital, Dhaka, explains, ""There's a transitional stage called the climacteric. It includes perimenopause, the early shift, and post-menopause, which follows after periods have permanently stopped."" Perimenopause typically begins in a woman's early to mid-40s, though some experience symptoms earlier. It can last anywhere from a few months to over a decade. During this time, oestrogen, the hormone responsible for regulating the menstrual cycle, mood, and reproductive health, fluctuates unpredictably. This hormonal imbalance affects the brain, heart, bones, and even digestion. ""You might have irregular periods, or go two or three months without one, and then suddenly get two in a single month,"" says Dr Akhter. ""The ovaries begin to reduce their hormone response, but not all at once. That's why the symptoms can be so erratic."" ""I was snapping at my children for no reason, crying during meetings, and waking up at 3 AM every night. I thought I was just burned out."" Many women initially misattribute their experiences, describing it as a period of ""emotional short-circuiting."" In truth, they are going through a biological transformation that affects every woman, yet is rarely explained well. The range of symptoms can be broad and deeply personal. From sudden heat in the face and chest — hot flashes — to insomnia, depression, vaginal dryness, brain fog, digestive trouble, and loss of libido, the body starts to send signals that many find hard to interpret. ""Hot flashes are a hallmark symptom,"" says Dr Akhter. ""They usually last two to three minutes and cause the face and upper body to flush. For some women, they're barely noticeable; for others, they disrupt sleep and work. Stress and lifestyle factors can worsen them."" Psychological symptoms are just as common. Mood swings, irritability, or even unexplained grief can descend without warning. Hormones regulate the reproductive system and the brain. As oestrogen drops, women can feel mentally unbalanced, like they're not themselves anymore. ""I thought pregnancies cannot happen if periods are months apart"" One common misconception is that once periods become irregular, fertility ends, but that's not necessarily true. A largely unspoken aspect of this life stage is its impact on intimacy and sexual health. Vaginal dryness, discomfort during intercourse, and reduced desire are all common but rarely addressed. ""After oestrogen declines, the vaginal lining thins and loses elasticity,"" explains Dr Akhter. ""This can cause painful sex, urinary discomfort, or even cystitis. Many women suffer in silence because they don't know this is connected to menopause."" Dr Akhter encourages women to speak up and seek help. ""These are natural changes, and they can be managed – either through lifestyle, topical treatments, or in certain cases, hormone therapy."" In Bangladesh, hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is prescribed conservatively due to potential side effects. ""We try to start with non-medical solutions,"" says Dr Akhter. ""Good sleep, regular exercise, a calcium-rich diet, and emotional support go a long way."" She adds, ""If symptoms become unmanageable — severe insomnia, mood crashes, unbearable hot flashes — we do consider HRT but only in minimal doses and with close monitoring. Side effects like breast tenderness, irregular bleeding, or reduced breast firmness can occur."" ""I would cry in the shower and then walk into the office like nothing happened. I didn't even know it was hormonal"" For those without access to specialists, the first line of treatment is often understanding and reassurance. ""The role of psychological support is huge,"" says Dr Akhter. ""Sometimes, women just need to hear that what they're experiencing is normal and that it will pass."" Despite its inevitability, menopause remains a topic shrouded in discomfort. In South Asian households, where women's identities are still tied closely to reproductive roles, this transition is viewed as a loss rather than an evolution. ""Menopause doesn't mean a woman's value has ended,"" says Dr Akhter firmly. ""It's a time for reflection, for shifting priorities, and embracing maturity with strength."" Hossain puts it best: ""I thought menopause would mean life slowing down. But instead, it gave me clarity. I stopped worrying about monthly cycles and started focusing on myself. I only wish I had known more about what to expect."" Perimenopause and menopause are not medical tragedies; rather, they are deeply human transitions. With education, support, and agency, women can reclaim this stage not as a decline, but as a redefining of their lives. ""Menopause is not a disease,"" Dr Akhter emphasises. ""It's a phase. With the right tools — physical, emotional, and social — women can move through it with dignity."" In a country like Bangladesh, where health conversations are still layered with stigma, breaking the silence around menopause is not just necessary — it's liberating. Because every woman deserves to understand her body, and every woman deserves to feel whole, even as she changes. ‘ব্যক্তিপর্যায়ে কিছুটা স্বস্তি দিতে এসব ব্যবস্থা বিবেচনা করা হচ্ছে।’",2025-05-11T19:33:13+06:00

These fresh juice recipes bring together the earthy sweetness of fruits, the sharp kick of ginger and chilli, and the timeless tang of citrus. Whether it's the smoky charm of pora aamer sharbat or the subtle elegance of watermelon juice laced with honey and sea salt, each recipe here celebrates the art of cooling down! Ingredients
 8 cups watermelon cut into 2-inch cubes 1 tsp raw honey ½ tsp kosher or sea salt 1-2 sprigs of fresh herbs, such as mint or basil (optional) Method Place a fine mesh strainer over a large bowl and set aside. Place watermelon, honey and salt in a blender. Blend on high until no chunks remain. Depending on the size of your blender, you may need to do this in two batches. Pour into the strainer and press the pulp with a wooden spoon to extract all of the juice. Pour the juice into a container with a tight-fitting lid. Chill. When ready to serve, shake vigorously (because it tends to separate) and serve with a sprig of herbs, if using. Ingredients 
 4 raw mangoes ¼ cup fresh mint ½ roasted cumin powder ¼ tsp roasted dry red chilli powder 1 cup sugar 2 tsp black salt 6 cup water Method Wash and dry the raw mangoes. Using a fork, prick it all over. Roast the mangoes over direct heat for about 10 minutes. Peel the skin and let it cool. Using your hands pull out all the pulp. Take the pulp in a blender. Add sugar, black salt, roasted cumin powder, roasted red chilli powder, mint and blend to make a paste. Add water and blend again. Refrigerate for about 2 hours. Pour the glasses and serve chilled. Ingredients
 4 carrots 2 apples 2 tbsp honey/sugar (to taste) ¾ cup to 1 cup water Method Scrub carrots well and wash them; peel off the skins if needed. Peel off 2 apples and chop them into small slices. Chop the carrot into small cubes. Take it in a blender, add water little by little and puree it smoothly. Now strain this through a fine strainer, you can strain this using a clean cloth. Blend the apples separately; strain. Now add honey and apple juice to the carrot juice and mix well. Chill this for an hour. Serve cold. Ingredients
 1 large piece of fresh ginger (about 3-4 inches) 4-5 lemons (freshly juiced) 2-3 tbsp honey or sweetener of choice (adjust to taste) Ice cubes (optional) Method Peel the fresh ginger root and cut it into small pieces. Grate the ginger with a little bit of water to create a smooth paste. Place the grated ginger in a fine sieve or cheesecloth, and press or squeeze it to extract the juice. You should have around 2-3 tablespoons of fresh ginger juice. Squeeze the juice from the lemons and strain it to remove seeds or pulp. In a large pitcher, combine the freshly squeezed lemon juice, ginger juice, and cold water. Stir well to mix. Add honey (or your preferred sweetener) to taste. Stir until it's dissolved completely. If you want a tangy flavour, feel free to adjust the amount of sweetener. Pour the ginger lemonade into glasses filled with ice cubes (optional). Ingredients
 5 cups diced watermelon ¾ cup raspberries 2 cups coconut water ¼ cup lime juice 2 tsp sugar Handful of mint leaves Method Firstly, dice up a watermelon to attain 5 cups of it. Blend this to get a fine juice and then strain this through a fine mesh sieve. Get rid of all the seeds and fruit pulp so that you are left with thin and translucent watermelon juice.   Next, cut raspberries into halves and puree them in a blender. After getting a fine puree, pass this through a sieve to get rid of all the seeds and solid substances. Add in 2 teaspoons of sugar to this and mix well. Squeeze a couple of limes and remove their seeds to get a 1/4 cup of lime juice.  Combine all these prepared ingredients together in a blender along with 2 cups of coconut water. Pulse them for a few seconds until you get a clear and homogenous mixture. You can adjust the level of sweetness by adding more sugar according to your taste preference. Lastly, chill this in the refrigerator and garnish with a sprig of mint before serving to add a pop of colour and a burst of freshness. This tastes best when served cold.",2025-05-11T19:25:56+06:00
https://www.thedailystar.net/life-living/news/dilnawaz-dance-drama-where-love-transcends-the-mortal-veil-3892216,Dilnawaz: A dance drama where love transcends the mortal veil,https://www.thedailystar.net/life-living/news/dilnawaz-dance-drama-where-love-transcends-the-mortal-veil-3892216,"Dilnawaz fuses Sufi philosophy, classical dance, and Urdu literature to tell a mystical tale of love and transcendence, reclaiming the stage as sacred space and guiding audiences on a soulful journey toward divine union.  Drawing from Sufi philosophy and fusing classical and contemporary dance traditions, Dilnawaz offers not just a spectacle, but an experience of the soul's deepest longings. Produced by Shadhona and directed by Lubna Marium, this performance revives a forgotten fable from Urdu literature, bringing to life the story of a slave girl, whose journey through love leads her to spiritual transcendence. Drawn from the lost but resurrected short story by Rahat Ara Begum, a writer whose pen was once silenced by political divide. The production charts the inner odyssey of a handmaiden in a royal court. Dilnawaz, the humble slave girl, traverses the perilous terrain of longing and surrender, her love for an oblivious prince becoming her gateway to spiritual transcendence. Her journey, told in seven movements that echo the seven stages of Sufi love, is anything but servile. Attraction (hub), Infatuation (uns), Love (ishq), Trust (akidat), Worship (ibadat), Madness (junoon), and finally, Annihilation (fana) — each stage strips away another layer of self, until only pure essence remains. Through a deft fusion of the Mugham dance traditions, Indian classical Kathak, and the sinuous rhythms of contemporary jazz, the dance drama embodies the universal yearning for union; not merely with the beloved, but with the Divine. It is no accident that Rahat Ara Begum — herself a practicing Sufi in 1940s Kolkata — wove this mystical thread into her only foray into mythic storytelling. And it is fitting that her granddaughter, Lubna Marium, would spend ten patient years nurturing this vision, culminating in six intense months of rehearsal to bring Dilnawaz to the stage. ""Not a dry eye in the hall,"" Marium recalls, but she stood firm for the story, and demanded nothing less than total devotion. Mubasshira Kamal Era, who embodies Dilnawaz, delivers a performance that goes beyond dance; it becomes ritual. Her portrayal captures heartbreak and ecstasy in equal measure, her body a vessel for emotions that words cannot contain. ""For a whole 10 minutes, I just spun,"" she says. ""I was in a trance. The claps, the awe in the audience, I could feel them, though they didn't reach me. My body was just in a trance, something I felt from within."" That moment, a solitary figure spinning, lost in divine madness, became the production's heartbeat. Era's own journey adds another layer of poignance: once driven away from dance by bullying, she returned years later to stand before an audience of over 700, everyone on their feet, caught in collective rapture. Dilnawaz is not content with mere narration. It communicates, blending classical rigor with contemporary freedom, weaving South Asian and Middle Eastern traditions into a single fabric. Each movement, each gesture, is charged with the sacred duty of conveying the ineffable. It is this alchemy that has left audiences spellbound and hearts unguarded. As Lubna Marium puts it, ""Performance transcends the world through art. With Dilnawaz, we present a story of love, devotion, and mysticism, weaving together South Asian and Middle Eastern performance traditions."" At a time when art is often reduced to entertainment, Dilnawaz reclaims the stage as sacred space. It reminds us that love, in its truest, most transformative form, is both the path and the destination. Like the Sufi seekers before her, Dilnawaz dances not for applause, but for annihilation. And in doing so, she invites us to shed our own layers, to spin until we too, touch the eternal.   Photo: Courtesy

Curated by renowned designer Maheen Khan, the event showcased a stunning collection of handwoven silk garments, including saris, jackets, and embroidered quilts (nakshi katha). Sponsored by Hyundai, UCB, and Berger, this exhibition highlighted the country's vibrant craft traditions and their relevance to new age fashion. Maheen Khan's journey into the world of artisanal craft and design began early. ""I started right after college at 21, in 1986,"" she shared. ""For nearly 16 years, I worked in a more institutional setting, focusing on product development. That experience helped me understand grassroots craftsmanship and appreciate the incredible skill of local artisans who have preserved our cultural heritage across generations."" She explained that Bangladesh's traditional arts — needlework, weaving, embroidery — are deeply ingrained in its history, shaped by centuries of cultural influences from South Asia, Southeast Asia, and colonial powers such as England and Europe. Her collaborations with handloom weavers from regions like Rajshahi and Chapainawabganj played an important role in her understanding of traditional techniques. ""Our handwoven silk is very durable, strong, and tactile,"" she said. ""When designing heirloom-quality products, the fabric must be of exceptional quality—resilient enough to last for generations."" Through her collections, she aims to balance respect for tradition with modern tastes. Over the past two and a half years, she has developed a collection of silk sarees inspired by Bangladesh's diverse history, integrating traditional motifs with contemporary design elements. Maheen Khan's collections are heavily inspired by Bangladesh's layered cultural influences, including Islamic geometric patterns, Arabesque motifs, and indigenous Bengali designs. ""Bangladesh's history is a melting pot — Dutch, Portuguese, English, and local Sultanate influences have all shaped our aesthetic,"" she explained. ""Despite its small size, our country's art and craft carry the weight of a thousand years of cultural synthesis."" She stresses that traditional craft is not just art — it is a livelihood. Many artisans rely on needlework and textile arts as their primary income, making their support crucial. In Jamalpur, she works directly with artisans, training and upskilling them to ensure that their craftsmanship remains relevant and sustainable. ""We aim to create slow fashion — garments crafted with patience, designed to be treasured and passed down,"" she said. ""Colour choice is key. I love ivory because it's timeless and versatile. For summer, we select pastels that evoke serenity and freshness; for winter, jewel tones like deep reds and emerald greens. Every decision is thoughtful, from the fabrics to the motifs."" Her inspiration from traditional Bengali designs like shitol pati, terracotta patterns, and woven geometric motifs is evident in her work. Maheen Khan also explained that every piece in her collection tells a story. ""It's a journey from the raw yarn to the finished garment,"" she said. ""Every stage bears human touch — done by hand — making each item unique. I carefully curate the details, from embroidery to finishing."" She credits her collaboration with master curators like Shaibal Shaha for maintaining the authenticity of her work, trusting his spontaneous judgment to bring her vision to life. Looking forward, Maheen Khan's primary goal is to elevate Bangladesh's textile and craft industry globally. ""We need more support and investment. Our traditional crafts are sustainable, slow, and rooted in culture. The world is increasingly focused on sustainability, and our artisanal practices fit perfectly with that movement,"" she said. ""By showcasing our heritage, we can build a valuable niche on the international stage."" Beyond commercial aspirations, Maheen Khan emphasises cultural pride. ""Our heritage isn't static,"" she said. ""It's a living, evolving story. I want our craft to be recognised worldwide, not just as traditional art but as a modern, sustainable industry that empowers local artisans and preserves our identity."" She believes that with more exposure, investment, and strategic partnerships, Bangladesh can shift from being primarily known for readymade garments to being celebrated globally for its handcrafted textiles, too. Her vision extends beyond individual collections. She aims to foster a global appreciation for Bangladesh's artisanal wealth and to ensure artisans receive fair recognition and support. ""Supporting local artisans isn't just good business — it's a moral obligation,"" she asserted. ""When artisans succeed, they become ambassadors of our culture, and their work helps us preserve our heritage while creating meaningful economic change.""   Photo: Courtesy

Late nights? Banned. Junk food? Dream on. Spontaneous outings? Only if they involved groceries. Screen time? Monitored like a national security threat. But somehow, the older I got, the more I realised those no's weren't roadblocks; they were safety nets. Back then, it felt unfair. While my friends lived the best life—junk food, sleepovers, Netflix marathons—I was indoors doing homework under the watchful eyes of General Mom. I called it ""house arrest"". She called it ""parenting"". But here's the thing I didn't realise until much later: she wasn't trying to ruin my life; she was trying to shape it. While I saw restrictions, she saw protection. While I sulked about rules, she was silently building me a future where I'd thank her for every ""no"" she ever said. But with time, things changed. One day, curious about her sudden chill mode, I asked why she wasn't as strict anymore. She looked at me with that knowing smile and said, ""There's a time for everything."" No long explanation; just one of those quiet truths she always seems to carry in her back pocket. We expect mothers to be superhuman. Warmth on demand, food on the table, patience always stocked, and a smile through every chaos. But we forget – this is her first time too. She is figuring things out as she goes, making mistakes, getting back up, and doing it all over again. Coming to working moms? Absolute legends. They clock out of the office and clock into their second job without flinching. Stay-at-home moms? Equally heroic, running homes like CEOs, minus the bonuses and coffee breaks. Society often praises what it can see – promotions, paychecks, performance reviews. But motherhood is measured in lullabies sung through exhaustion, meals cooked without complaint, lessons taught through patience, and love given endlessly, even when none is returned. To every mother – whether you're balancing board meetings and baby bottles, or spending your days running a home that never pauses – you are more than enough. And my mom? She juggled both roles. She worked a full-time job and still made time for spelling tests, fever checks, surprise Tupperware hunts, and emotional therapy sessions disguised as dinner chats. I, of course, still found reasons to complain – cold food, a house not organised, and clothes not ironed (my own fault, but still). So if you ever wonder what a superhero looks like—don't look up. Look home. She's probably in the kitchen reheating your food... again. So, here's to the unsung hero in every home. To every mother – who makes love look easy, patience look endless, and multitasking look magical. Because let's face it—if motherhood were a paid job, no company could afford the salary. ‘ব্যক্তিপর্যায়ে কিছুটা স্বস্তি দিতে এসব ব্যবস্থা বিবেচনা করা হচ্ছে।’",2025-05-11T19:37:45+06:00
https://www.thedailystar.net/campus/news/how-the-us-funding-cuts-are-affecting-international-graduate-students-3889106,How the US funding cuts are affecting international graduate students,https://www.thedailystar.net/campus/news/how-the-us-funding-cuts-are-affecting-international-graduate-students-3889106,"Academia in the US has been severely shaken after the second term of the Trump administration began in January. From federal funding cuts to demands for policy changes, many universities have been hit hard, with international students feeling the brunt of the effects. Many US federal agencies have had their funds slashed or have been ordered to be slashed or frozen, including the National Institute of Health (NIH) which funds portions of medical research in many research institutions nationwide. This has, in turn, led to research grants being cut or threatened to be cut for many universities in the US, causing major layoffs and jeopardising research in the medical field, climate sciences, and social sciences. The Trump administration has been actively leveraging the NIH funding to force US universities to change their policies regarding Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) and pro-Palestine sentiments on campus. As a result, universities are having to shrink department sizes, reduce student intake, slash funding for students, and even rescind offer letters. This has created immense uncertainty for current and prospective international students, who already face more barriers than domestic students, and may have far-reaching consequences for the future of academia. ""Despite their prestige, US schools feel increasingly inaccessible. It's hard to commit to a programme when financial uncertainty constantly looms over the experience,"" says Anika Tabassum Amreen, a US graduate school applicant. Higher education in the US is notorious for being incredibly expensive, more so for international students, but this was alleviated by the generous scholarships given by US schools. However, now that those scholarships are far fewer in number due to funding cuts, they have become much less reliable. Students who had hoped for these scholarships to fund their higher education now face the unprecedented challenge of navigating other ways of securing funding. While domestic students can still work and pay for their tuition, international students don't enjoy the same freedom. ""As an international student, employment is restricted to on-campus jobs, making the search even more challenging,"" says Amreen. Furthermore, graduate assistantships and other on-campus opportunities can be highly competitive, making them inaccessible to most students.  So what other choice are international students left with? Not much. Financial burdens and visa uncertainties are leading many to reconsider the US as their study destination. ""I am not going to be prioritising US programmes for the time being until there is more clarity regarding the situation surrounding higher education there,"" says Hamza Mohammed, a prospective PhD student, who had initially intended to study in the US but is now considering other regions as well, such as Europe. Many students applying to US schools have also reported that their admissions or scholarships were rescinded. ""Cornell is trying to make sure the current students have secured funding before taking in new students,"" says Nabila Nawar Binti, a graduate research assistant at Cornell University. More than one billion USD in funding for Cornell was frozen according to the White House. While it is only right that universities prioritise supporting their already existing students before they can fund incoming ones, this puts prospective students at a disadvantage as it makes admission and securing scholarships that much more difficult. ""Two of the universities where I had obtained funding informed me that they will no longer be able to provide the promised funding due to cuts to their research budgets,"" says Hamza. As the US is the premier study destination for students around the world, this will certainly put the academic aspirations of many international students in jeopardy. The funding cuts are not only affecting prospective students in the US but also current ones. ""A lot of the students who expected funding were still doing rotations when they found out about the cuts, so they had to find additional rotations while their funding was frozen,"" says Nabila. Rotations are short research experiences, usually spanning a few weeks, that graduate students cycle through in order to gain experience and find which research areas are best suited for them. Having to do more lab rotations, because the funding for their own research got frozen, spells delays for these students' own research work, which is a significant hurdle for students who want to complete their degrees in a timely manner. Universities themselves have also been struggling to manage, with massive damage being done to research efforts. Todd Wolfson, president of the American Association of University Professors, told The Guardian, ""Members of mine are having to lay people off and having to close their labs. It's been a complete, utter, destruction of the United States research infrastructure."" This not only affects students' education but also on-campus employment opportunities for current students, as many international students rely on research assistant and teaching assistant positions to pay for their tuition. If laid off, they will be left without this support, and the financial burden may become unbearable. The Trump administration's demand for scrapping DEI programmes that supported underrepresented and underprivileged groups can also have a significant impact on international students. An example of DEI programmes that support international students is the International Mentoring Program at Brown University which pairs incoming international students with mentors from within the student body to guide them in academic and social matters. Another example is the Associated Students of the University of Washington (ASUW), a student association at the University of Washington which provides students identity-based support, access to legislative advocacy, and inclusive programming. If the DEI scrapping measures target programmes and organisations such as this, international students will be left at a disadvantage. The administration also demanded that institutions change their admission processes ""to prevent admitting international students hostile to the American values"", without clearly specifying what is exactly meant by ""American values"". This is certain to harm many international students from around the world, whose academic careers could be harmed by such arbitrary notions. Additionally, the government's demands that universities must report students engaged in political protests and overhaul their campus protest policies in order to address ""anti-semitism"" will not only negatively impact many current students but also deter many international students from applying to American universities in the near future.  Columbia University has yielded to many of the administration's demands, in hopes of restoring funding worth USD 400 million. On the other hand, Harvard University has refused to budge despite threats of massive funding cuts, with its president Alan Garber asserting Harvard's commitment to autonomy as a private institution. Following Harvard's lead, a collective of other elite schools have joined forces to combat the demands made by the Trump administration, with their leaders reportedly having discussions on how to effectively resist said demands. Other prominent universities, such as Stanford University, University of Pennsylvania, and University of Michigan, have also been targeted by the administration. At this point, it is a lose-lose situation for international students, because if the universities yield to the demands, it will make higher education a lot more tumultuous for them as the DEI measures will have to be scrapped, they will be scrutinised more heavily during the admission process, and there will be a looming threat of losing funding should the universities accept more of the Trump administration's whims in the future. However, if the universities decide to resist instead, they will probably have much less money at their disposal, thus many international students will be left without funding or even admission offers. International students make invaluable contributions towards research in the US. Thus, considering the difficulties they face now and are likely to continue facing under the current administration, the future of American graduate education looks grim. With a smaller pool of researchers, a shrunken budget, and the general volatility of the political climate, a perfect storm beckons over the horizon. ""Not only budget cuts, but visa revocation of many international students in recent times, along with some other probable policy changes will grossly impact the future of graduate education,"" says Dr Tanvir R Faisal, an assistant professor at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette. On top of all this chaos, the visa application process is already mired with a great deal of uncertainty. Even if you get offered admission and somehow manage to secure sufficient funding, there is always the possibility that your visa will be rejected and your dreams of attending graduate school in the US will be shattered. This is nothing new, but it piles up with all the other obstacles that prospective international students are facing. It is still difficult to tell exactly how detrimental the Trump administration's actions will be to academia, but there is no doubt that they will be severe. And yet, hope cannot be lost, and there are practical measures that can be taken to mitigate the onslaught of funding cuts. According to Dr Faisal, ""One possible option is (for universities) to negotiate with state legislators to increase state-level funding, increase industrial ties for funding, and discuss/raise the issues with congressmen/~women and senators of respective states/congressional districts to reinstate or increase the federal budget for higher education."" Needless to say, the recent measures taken by US President Trump have caught the world of academia off guard, especially international students. Arguably, they are feeling the worst of the effects, from slashed funding to fewer opportunities to even being targeted by authorities. Only time will tell how much longer these conditions will persist, and much will depend on how university authorities decide to tackle the administration's demands and what they do to counteract them.

At a press conference held outside the RUCSU building at 1:00pm today, they called for the list to be published within three days, warning that failure to do so would be viewed as an attempt to sabotage the polls. They demanded that only students enrolled at Rajshahi University up to April 28, 2025, be included in the list and called for strict adherence to the previously announced election roadmap, including setting a specific date for the vote. The group also asked the RUCSU Election Commission to announce the election schedule within seven days following consultations with stakeholders. They urged the university administration to restrict the entry of outsiders and motorcycles to ensure campus security. In their written statement, the former coordinators alleged that different administrative wings of the university were showing reluctance and raising doubts about the election. While a roadmap has been declared, they said it was not being followed. They pointed out that the election code of conduct was supposed to be issued on April 13 and the draft voter list on April 28 — neither of which had been fulfilled. The delay, they claimed, appeared deliberate and raised questions about the administration's intent, undermining students' trust in the process. They believe the confrontational stance of political parties in recent days is disrupting the academic environment and creating security concerns on campus. Responding to a reporter's question, former coordinator Mehedi Sajeeb said, ""We are not naming anyone directly, but if there had been no obstruction, the draft voter list would have been published on time. The administration announced a date but is now making excuses. The Election Commission hasn't even held a single meeting."" He said the lack of initiative suggested an absence of will within the university authorities. ""Had there been genuine interest, Rajshahi University could have led the way in reviving student union elections in the country,"" he said. On whether the suspension of the Rajshahi University Alumni Association (RUAA) election might affect RUCSU, he said, ""RUAA involves former students, while RUCSU is for current ones. But the way the RUAA election was stopped gives rise to fears that similar tactics may be applied here. We are linking the two incidents."" Prof Amzad Hossain, the chief election commissioner of the RUCSU election, said he had just returned to Rajshahi and received the relevant letter only a day earlier. ""I was out of Rajshahi for a few days. After returning, I received the letter yesterday. I will soon call everyone and hold a meeting. We are very positive about the RUCSU election,"" he said. ‘ব্যক্তিপর্যায়ে কিছুটা স্বস্তি দিতে এসব ব্যবস্থা বিবেচনা করা হচ্ছে।’",2025-05-05T16:35:09+06:00

This prompted us to study 20 cases of gender-based violence (GBV) on public university campuses between May 2023 and October 2024, uncovering deep-rooted systemic issues. The incidents, which included sexual harassment, assault, and discriminatory policies, predominantly impacted women and gender-diverse individuals. While some perpetrators were held accountable, institutional responses remained inconsistent and were often shaped by power dynamics. Many survivors chose not to report their experiences, deterred by stigma and a lack of trust in the system. The scenario is not all that different in private universities. We spoke to a victim in the middle of last year, back when hope still poured out of her voice. She believed in the system then – felt that enough people cared, that the university's administration would do right by her. There was conviction in her words, a confidence that justice was within reach. When we reached out again a few days ago, she was barely recognisable. The confidence she had just a year prior eroded, replaced by something brittle – something broken. Not just disappointment, but exhaustion. She is a student at Dhaka University and wishes to remain anonymous. ""After the uprising, I keep hearing about reform,"" she tells us. ""When I approached the authorities, they said changes are underway, and that's why no decision has been made yet.""  But she isn't convinced. To her, the delays are not about policy changes or bureaucratic red tape. They are about something more familiar: a sheer lack of importance and neglect. A way of waiting just long enough for the issue to fade, for the voices to quiet, and for justice to be forgotten. Another student from a renowned private university in Bangladesh echoed the sentiments of her fellow student from Dhaka University. In her case, it was a faculty member who conducted themselves inappropriately. ""He had been my advisor back in the first semester. When I went to the campus for the first time to get my advising done, he put me in his class. Later on, during the semester, I had missed a class. When I went back to the next class, he asked me whether or not I wanted to visit his office during consultation hours so that he could help cover whatever I had missed. When I got there, however, he spent very little time teaching me anything and eventually began asking me personal questions and making inappropriate remarks,"" she recalls. Although she wanted to report what had happened to her, she did not do so because she felt like nothing would be done even if she took measures. ""This isn't the first time something like this has happened. He has also made someone else I know very uncomfortable by saying crude things,"" she says. ""I am certain he has done similar things to multiple students. Even if at least one of them reported their experience in the past, it's clear that adequate measures were not taken. So, it occurred to me that it wouldn't make a difference even if I reported my experience."" Speaking to Dr Saifuddin Ahmed, Proctor of Dhaka University, revealed several administrative shortcomings in ensuring campus safety. He says, ""While policies addressing sexual harassment do exist, there are no regular training sessions to raise awareness among students or staff. Although there are broad guidelines, the university lacks a clear and enforceable service rule for its employees."" Dr Ahmed stressed the importance of making students aware of these policies and reporting systems if they are subjected to sexual harassment. He noted that efforts are underway to improve this. He also highlighted various legal and procedural challenges. These include difficulties in collecting practical evidence, procedural delays, fear of social stigma, and concerns about academic harassment. Dr Ahmed underscored the importance of establishing a system that ensures the confidentiality of victims throughout the entire reporting and investigation process. He also mentioned plans to work with legal experts to develop checklists that would not derail the progress of cases, even if there is a change in university administration. Dr Ahmed further pointed out flaws in the process of appointing faculty members. He says, ""Strong academic results alone should not determine a candidate's suitability for a teaching position. Instead, it is equally important to assess whether the individual demonstrates integrity and ethical conduct."" Following the interview with the proctor, one could not help but sense a troubling absence of urgency – or perhaps will – in addressing sexual harassment on campus. Policies, it appears, do exist in theory, and if earnestly applied, they might as well serve as deterrents. Yet it is precisely the ""if"" that lingers: the mechanisms of implementation remain elusive.   Musharrat Sharmee Hossain, a senior lecturer at the Department of English and Modern Languages in North South University (NSU) and a former assistant proctor who was also involved in formulating NSU's code of conduct explains, ""There are multiple ways for students to reach out and report their experiences. Even then, incidents of sexual violence are not reported, which one could claim is a national problem. Victims tend to be reluctant to disclose their experiences, in which case a teacher (with whom they feel comfortable) might encourage or help them to do so.""  ""As there is an inclination to attach shame to the victims' experiences, people still harbour the belief that talking about whatever happened to them will pose issues in the future or even invite trouble from their parents,"" she adds. While Musharrat Sharmee reinforced NSU's commitment to ensuring the safety of its students, she did mention that the code of conduct needs to be updated or revised, especially in terms of clauses pertaining to students' online safety. She also mentioned that she did not receive any mandatory training on preventing harassment. In an interview with Ekhon Television, Dr Upama Kabir, head of Dhaka University's Anti-Sexual Harassment Cell, says, ""As the previous committee neither resolved past cases nor provided any conclusions or decisions, these cases remain pending. Once they are reassigned to us, we will conduct a re-verification and proceed with the necessary next steps."" It was a High Court directive issued 16 years ago that instructed universities to set up sexual harassment prevention committees. While it was an initiative worthy of praise, time has revealed that the order fell short in really tackling the issue. And that is because policymakers have failed to properly perceive and diagnose the roots of the problem: a culture that not only breeds dominance but relies on it to control and thwart the autonomy of women and gender-diverse individuals. As a result, it views incidents of harassment as isolated occurrences and not a result of the culture of dominance. Nonetheless, if individuals from these very demographics are not involved in formulating policies and their concerns are continued to be shunned out, then this vicious cycle will continue.  That is not to say that institutional policies are not needed. They are required to tackle the pressing issue that has been borne out of the gross negligence displayed towards the safety of women and gender-diverse individuals. Moreover, the most fundamental function of these institutions is to educate and enlighten young minds. They wield significant influence not only on the discourse surrounding issues of sexual violence but also in terms of informing people, raising awareness, and to various extents breaking the stigma that prevails. The culture of domination is pervasive. And as institutions that continue to function with it in the backdrop, they bear some responsibility in dismantling it. ‘ব্যক্তিপর্যায়ে কিছুটা স্বস্তি দিতে এসব ব্যবস্থা বিবেচনা করা হচ্ছে।’",2025-05-01T10:00:00+06:00
https://www.thedailystar.net/campus/career/news/signs-you-are-being-exploited-your-internship-3886081,Signs that you are being exploited in your internship,https://www.thedailystar.net/campus/career/news/signs-you-are-being-exploited-your-internship-3886081,"Internships are short-term work opportunities where students or young professionals – mostly recent graduates – can gain hands-on experience in a particular field. Be it paid or unpaid, on-site or remote, the primary objectives of internships remain the same – to develop skills, gain industry exposure, and open doors to future opportunities. Interns expect to have access to opportunities, skill development, mentorship, networking, and even chances to explore different career paths. At the same time, employers seek fresh ideas, task support, and a chance to train potential hires when hiring interns. Basically, an internship serves as a valuable opportunity for both interns and employers. However, while internships may appear mutually beneficial, they can often be exploitative where interns are overworked, underpaid, or deprived of meaningful learning experiences. Thus, for interns or those seeking internship opportunities, being aware of whether or not they are being exploited has become vital in this day and age. The signs of such form of exploitation at the workplace are always there; you just have to look out for them. You are doing a full-time job on an intern's salary or, worse, for free Even though your job description clearly mentioned the working hours and the number of days you'd get off, now that you have finally signed up for the job, the reality can be far different from what was mentioned earlier. You often find yourself working overtime. You might be in a situation where nobody tells you when to stop. Even if the task can be done the next day, you are told that the task must be done immediately. If this is a daily scene at your internship, chances are you are being taken advantage of. No one is teaching you anything Internships are meant to be learning experiences. There should be arrangements for you to learn new things, and they should be provided to you by your employer in the form of mentorship, training sessions, or at least meaningful guidance. However, if you are constantly told to just get things done and have to figure most work or on-job related things out on your own, this is sort of exploitative. Even if they say that you have to learn while doing your daily tasks or you have to learn everything on your own, it comes off as exploitative. Self-learning is important but it should be structured with guidance, not substituted entirely with work. Your pay keeps getting delayed If your internship is paid, timely compensation should be non-negotiable. You might see that full-time employees are getting paid on time but your pay keeps getting delayed for one reason or another with varying excuses. If this keeps repeating, it's a strong indication that your employer does not respect your time or contribution. Paid working opportunities – be it full-time or an internship – means getting paid on time, and repeated failure in this regard is not a good sign. You are given responsibilities beyond your expertise with no support Challenging tasks are great for growth. But if challenges mean you are given responsibilities beyond your expertise without any support, things can actually turn out bitter. You might do your best to meet expectations, but without guidance, you're likely to struggle. And when the work doesn't turn out as expected, the blame falls on you rather than the lack of direction. Your employer makes you feel replaceable You are giving your best shot while overcoming all the odds, yet your employer can still make you feel replaceable. Instead of appreciating your work, they keep complaining about it, give vague or demotivating feedback, and make you feel like you're always on thin ice. This isn't constructive criticism; it's a tactic to keep you insecure and compliant. And don't fall for the idea that this so-called 'criticism' is to get the best out of you. It's not. This is just your employer or supervisor making you feel bad about yourself so that they can take the opportunity to exploit you even more. If one or more of these signs are visible right now or in the future, it might be time to rethink your internship. While internships can be valuable, they can also become exploitative if boundaries are not set. If you feel undervalued, overworked, or ignored, it's important to stand up for yourself. ‘ব্যক্তিপর্যায়ে কিছুটা স্বস্তি দিতে এসব ব্যবস্থা বিবেচনা করা হচ্ছে।’",2025-05-03T23:41:59+06:00
https://www.thedailystar.net/star-youth/news/challenges-female-drivers-face-bangladesh-3883551,Challenges female drivers face in Bangladesh,https://www.thedailystar.net/star-youth/news/challenges-female-drivers-face-bangladesh-3883551,"Picture this: a woman steers her way through gridlocked Dhaka traffic as ripples of turning heads follow in her wake. Curious glances, some fleeting and others lingering, turn instinctively — a few drawn from admiration, others laced with scepticism. The hum of engines and the cacophony of honking horns momentarily seem to pause as passing drivers, pedestrians, and rickshaw pullers steal a glance, as though the sight of a woman in control of the wheel is something otherworldly, something to behold. This is a stark reality that countless women in Bangladesh encounter every day. Despite an increasing number of female drivers gaining visibility over time, the streets still prevalently reflect a scene of male dominance. For many women, driving is not just about navigating the roads, but the need to overcome pervasive societal biases while grappling with safety concerns. Bushra Tabassum, a senior HR executive at an IT firm, has been behind the wheel for the past seven years. She acknowledges the common assumption that female drivers are incompetent, which initially unsettled her. ""People are adamant that women are bad drivers,"" she says. ""But I've learned to disregard it. Even my own friends doubted my abilities before witnessing my driving firsthand."" Bushra recounts facing a constant barrage of unfair accusations on the road. ""Accidents often result in immediate blame being directed towards me, regardless of culpability,"" she says. ""But I always speak up and confront any attempt to shift responsibility, be it from a male driver or a rickshaw puller."" However, for many, such has not been the case. Despite holding a driver's license since 2016, Rebeka Tanji Tania, Assistant Professor of Computer Science and Engineering at BGMEA University of Fashion & Technology (BUFT), still struggles to muster the confidence to drive on her own. ""Navigating the roads alongside male drivers requires being loud, assertive, and ready to defend oneself against unwarranted blame. In our country, traffic regulations are loosely implemented, and everyone drives however they please. Male drivers can easily assert control on the streets by shouting or swearing to tackle directed accusations because people are so used to it. But for me, that isn't quite the option,"" she speculates on her hesitancy. Female drivers often become a spectacle, being at the receiving end of unwanted attention, commentary, and even intimidation. While the scenario is relatively better in certain affluent regions inside Dhaka, challenges are far more harrowing in other parts of the country. ""While driving inside Cumilla district, I noticed that autorickshaw drivers would pause in the middle of the road, eventually leading to clogged traffic. They would blatantly stare at me in disbelief, that a woman is capable of steering the wheel, and even female passengers shared the same incredulous gaze. I have had similar experiences while driving in Mohammadpur as well,"" Mahamuda Peya, a former employee of bKash and British American Tobacco, shares. In Bangladesh, the lack of road safety awareness poses risks to all drivers, but for women, the challenges are amplified. Women are generally considered safer drivers than men, based on the ratio of road accidents accounted for by either group. However, the constant scrutiny that they encounter from outsiders plays as an external factor in interrupting their concentration while driving. Sarmily Sarker, Professor of Fashion Design at BUFT, has been driving in Bangladesh and abroad for almost a decade. Her endeavour began with riding a bicycle, then switching to a scooter during her student years, before she eventually bought a car. Reflecting on the erratic nature of Dhaka's streets, she states, ""People are remarkably unbothered about road safety. For instance, when I'm driving at high speed, pedestrians often raise a hand at the last moment and step onto the road, expecting traffic to pause instantaneously. It is incredibly difficult to halt on such short notice, and if an accident occurs, the blame inevitably falls on the driver. But people don't seem to realise the nuances."" In addition to all these setbacks, female drivers are constantly required to be on guard for their safety. For instance, the absence of proper parking spaces often creates significant security concerns for female drivers. Many hesitate to park in isolated areas, fearing harassment or worse. A great number of female drivers also refrain from using ride-sharing services like Uber as a source of possible income. ""Some areas are unsafe to go to alone, and people always try to create more problems for female drivers,"" Bushra laments. She recalls a distressing experience: ""One day, I was driving amidst heavy rainfall, and a car in front of me suddenly hit brakes. A man stepped out of the vehicle and tried to get inside my car. Since I was alone, I didn't take any risks. He lingered outside for a while, but I quickly drove away."" Similarly, Peya also recounts having to endure several unfortunate occurrences where she was subjected to verbal persecution by the mass public. Remembering one such incident, she says, ""While reversing out of a parking space, my car once crashed into another. Within minutes, a crowd gathered, and a group of bikers began insisting that the female driver's license be checked."" She continues, ""As the damage was significant on both ends, the police soon intervened. I refused to resolve because I was not at fault and demanded compensation. What shocked me most was that the officer reviewed the man's driving license immediately upon arrival, yet before that, the mob had only pressured me to show mine. I stood my ground and made it clear that they had no authority to demand my license. If I had to show mine, then so should the other person."" The rise in mob violence and frequent attacks on women heightens fears for female drivers. While speaking to our respondents, we found some of them expressing grave concern over the worsening state of public security in the country. Following recent events, many women consider themselves prone to rising threats of violence, further marginalising them. On top of that, frequent incidents of mugging and robbery flag them as easy targets and further fuel their unease about driving alone. Such concerns are not unfounded. Women on the road continue to face an uphill battle, from deep-seated negative mindsets to pressing security threats. While their presence behind the wheel is gradually increasing, the truth is that female drivers regularly continue to face a myriad of issues. Their experiences vastly differ from that of their male counterparts, and almost never in a positive way. Therefore, without improvised law and order and discernible changes in societal attitude, female drivers are constrained to battle against the challenges that continue to encumber them.

The phone uses Corning Gorilla Glass Ceramic 2 for durability and includes a 3,900 mAh battery. It will be available in Titanium Silver, Jet Black and Icy Blue colour variants.   The Galaxy S25 Edge launches in South Korea on May 23 before expanding to the US and over 30 other markets, including China and Europe, on May 30, with prices starting at $1,099.  The unusually timed release comes just four months after Samsung's flagship S25 debut, as the company faces growing competition from Apple's rumoured slim iPhone 17 Air and Chinese smartphone makers.

Just months after freezing hiring and letting its workforce shrink by 22% through attrition, CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski admitted the company's aggressive AI shift sacrificed service quality.   ""Investing in the quality of human support is the way of the future for us,"" Siemiatkowski told Bloomberg, according to a recent report, reversing course on a strategy that had slashed Klarna's headcount to 3,500 employees. The buy-now-pay-later company, valued at $14.6 billion, is now recruiting students, rural workers, and loyal customers for fully remote customer service roles.   The u-turn comes after Klarna's AI chatbot, launched in early 2024, quickly handled 75% of customer chats, 2.3 million conversations monthly, but drew criticism for robotic, scripted responses. Users complained the bot acted as little more than a ""filter"" to funnel complex issues to human agents.  Siemiatkowski, who had claimed on an X post in January that ""AI can already do all our jobs"", has now claimed to Bloomberg in a recent interview that replacing humans with AI has ""led to lower quality"". ""Investing in the quality of human support is the way of the future for us,"" he said to Bloomberg. Klarna had initially championed AI as a cost-cutting marvel, with Siemiatkowski telling staff in late 2024 to rely on AI to fill gaps left by departing colleagues. But after the chatbot struggled with nuanced tasks like refund negotiations and multilingual support. The reversal highlights the limits of AI in customer service, even for tech-forward firms. Klarna, which helped popularise BNPL loans and recently partnered with Walmart, now faces the delicate task of balancing automation with the human touch its large user base demands. ‘ব্যক্তিপর্যায়ে কিছুটা স্বস্তি দিতে এসব ব্যবস্থা বিবেচনা করা হচ্ছে।’",2025-05-12T11:56:09+06:00
https://www.thedailystar.net/tech-startup/news/combating-deepfakes-bangladesh-legislation-public-empowerment-3892336,Combating deepfakes in Bangladesh: legislation to public empowerment,https://www.thedailystar.net/tech-startup/news/combating-deepfakes-bangladesh-legislation-public-empowerment-3892336,"Bangladesh's recent enactment of the Cyber Security Ordinance 2025 marks a pivotal moment in the nation's ongoing efforts to secure its digital ecosystem. This ordinance, which follows the contentious Cyber Security Act of 2023, promises a more balanced and rights-conscious approach. Significantly, it includes provisions criminalising cybercrimes involving artificial intelligence (AI)—a first for South Asia, and a necessary step given the escalating misuse of such technologies. However, legislation alone is not enough to address the broader challenges posed by AI, particularly the rise of deepfakes. These hyper-realistic, AI-generated audio and video forgeries can convincingly mimic individuals, spreading falsehoods with alarming ease. Having already influenced elections and public perception in countries like the United States and Canada, deepfakes are now proliferating in Bangladesh—most notably in the wake of recent political transitions. In recent months, digitally manipulated content targeting politicians and media personalities has gained traction, outpacing the ability of traditional fact-checking mechanisms to debunk it. A few days ago, Faiz Ahmad Taiyeb, special assistant to the chief adviser for the ICT Ministry, issued a stark warning: coordinated cyberattacks and disinformation campaigns are intensifying as the country approaches another critical election cycle. His remarks underscore how fragile democratic processes have become in the age of digital manipulation. The accessibility of deepfake technology compounds the threat. No longer confined to experts, these tools are now within reach of the average internet user. A joint investigation by CBC News, Bellingcat, and Danish media recently revealed that David Do, a Canadian hospital pharmacist, operated MrDeepFakes.com—the world's largest platform for non-consensual deepfake pornography. This case demonstrates how individuals, with minimal technical expertise, can inflict real harm on both public figures and private citizens. Despite the gravity, many countries, including Canada, lack specific laws to address the creation and distribution of such content. What makes deepfakes particularly dangerous is their ability to hijack human emotion. Ongoing research at Concordia University in Canada suggests that these manipulations succeed not because people are gullible, but because they evoke strong emotional responses that override critical thinking. Given this, Bangladesh must adopt a two-pronged strategy: strengthening legal frameworks while investing in public empowerment and education. A resilient digital society cannot be built through legislation alone. People must be equipped with the knowledge and tools to recognise and respond to misinformation. This means integrating digital literacy into the national curriculum. Students should learn how to identify manipulated media, understand the mechanics behind deepfakes, and practise responsible online behaviour. Public awareness campaigns, led by government agencies, NGOs and media outlets, are also essential. These should demystify AI technologies, highlight the risks they pose, and explain the value of fact-checking. Delivery should be multi-platform—television, radio, newspapers and social media—to ensure wide reach. Bangladesh can also tap into its youth. By training young volunteers as digital literacy ambassadors, communities can receive peer-led education on online safety. These efforts could be particularly effective in rural and underserved areas where misinformation often goes unchecked. Meanwhile, collaboration between universities and tech companies should be encouraged to develop and deploy AI-driven deepfake detection tools tailored to local platforms. Journalists and influencers, too, need training in content verification, enabling them to serve as credible sources for their audiences. AI is a double-edged sword. It can deceive, but it can also defend. Tools to detect manipulated content already exist, but their success hinges on public awareness and use. Ultimately, the strongest defence against digital misinformation is not just technological—it is social. Empowering citizens through education is not optional; it is indispensable. By fostering digital resilience and critical thinking—especially among the young—Bangladesh can safeguard not only the integrity of its elections but the health of its democracy.

https://www.thedailystar.net/tech-startup/news/curated-cars-the-dhaka-car-show-finally-got-it-right-3892131,Curated Cars: The Dhaka Car Show that finally got it right,https://www.thedailystar.net/tech-startup/news/curated-cars-the-dhaka-car-show-finally-got-it-right-3892131,"Let's face it, most Dhaka car shows are just chaos with a registration booth. Bikers revving like they're chasing ghosts, and yet another Corolla with a fart can exhaust pretending it's in 'Fast & Furious: Kuril Flyover Drift'. But May 1 and 2 gave us something rare. A proper show. Curated Cars wasn't just another excuse to hang out and say, ""Bro, my car faster."" This was for the real enthusiasts—the ones who actually know what a Jaguar S-Type is and don't think a McLaren is just a footballer. So what did they do differently?  I pulled up to the show, slightly sceptical. The 200 taka entry fee was already acting like a mosquito coil, keeping away the bored crowd who usually just show up because, well, there's nothing else to do in this city. What did I see instead? A clean layout. Cars arranged like an art exhibit. A 1969 Mustang stood proud in one corner, while the original pocket rocket in the form of a pocket-sized Mini took up space under the stairwell. The Toyota Century and Nissan President pair whispered presidential things to each other nearby. A duo of pristine late-60s Jaguar S-Types promised to sing the smooth, raspy opera that only old-school Brits can. If I am correct, one is a restomodded V8. There was even a McLaren for the TikTok generation. And for anime fans, sort of, a panda-colored AE86, one of just three in Bangladesh, and the non-pop-up light variant Levin at that. It sat there like an anime legend in steel form, unbothered by the flashier company. Something for every era. And then I saw something that's never part of Dhaka car meets: order. People could walk around. No one blocking views. Parking was sorted. You didn't need to elbow through a sea of vape clouds to get a good photo. So, I cornered the two madmen behind this miracle, Mustavi Irtiza Basher and Waiz Rahim, for a chat. We go way back, so I dusted off my hibernating automotive platform 'Shift' and pretended to be legit media again. Fake it till you make it, back into car journalism. Shift: First of all, bravo. The show had range and class. What was the original spark? Mustavi: We wanted to bring back genuine car culture. Something organised. Something that didn't feel like a rush job in a shopping mall basement. We'd been planning it for 10 months, but, true story, we confirmed the venue and actual event stuff barely two weeks before D-day. Shift: Wait, that organised feel… happened in two weeks? Waiz: I know, sounds nuts. But yeah, the planning, fundraising, and sponsor chasing, all done in about 10–14 days. We had our measuring tapes out, literally. Making sure every car could fit, move, and turn. Even then, a few headline cars backed out at the last minute. Thankfully, we had backups in mind. Shift: The field parking! People could breathe. Walk around. Even the cars outside were grouped neatly. No ""random Vitz next to a Porsche"" nonsense. Mustavi: That was the idea. We even pre-sorted the outdoor cars into themes before the event started. Placement mattered. We didn't want chaos to ruin the vibe. A lot of credit goes to Elev8 for the event management, and Elite Force, who helped with security. And then there's the Rahimoto crew, Maffaz and Aasman, they were everywhere, doing everything. Shift: Speaking of Rahimoto, that's your new thing, right, Waiz? Waiz: Yep. I've opened up an auto service workshop and tyre shop in Tejgaon called Rahimoto. We're authorised importers for Dunlop and DoubleStar tyres. Full engine work, suspension, AC, the works. It's not just a business, it's a continuation of our car obsession. Shift: Let's talk about the cars. How hard was it to convince owners to lend you their babies? Waiz: Some were excited. Others? Nervous as hell. Two full days, their prized machines parked under someone else's supervision, it's a big ask. But they trusted us. No one fussed over placement either. We had full control over the layout, which helped a ton. Shift: A lot of car shows get hijacked by brands, dealers slapping logos everywhere. You had BYD, BMW, and Ford, but they didn't take over. Waiz: That was intentional. We want to keep this community-first. Dealers and brands who can fit in with our community-first approach will always be welcomed. Without the support of BYD, BMW & Ford, we would not have been able to pull this off. BYD brought in cars that made sense. BMW and Ford helped, but didn't dominate. That's the balance we want. While walking around, I got to catch up with others in the community. Something that is the focal point of car shows, similar to SuperTuners Meet and the old hangouts by Shift. Aside from that, car shows in Dhaka have always been a bit of a gamble. Either you're stuck in a sweaty hall navigating a forest of tripods and TikTokers, or you're trying to appreciate a sports car parked between a cotton candy stand and a finance company's booth. The 'CEMS Dhaka Motorshow', which happened around the same time as this one, was no exception—chaotic, loud, and built for headcount, not heart. So here's the deal: Curated Cars wasn't just a car meet. It was a rare moment where form met function, where the scene took a deep breath, stood a little straighter, and remembered what car culture should be about. Real machines. Real stories. No revving for TikTok clout. Well, okay, there was some revving, especially the crowd-pleasing '69 Mustang with its gunship rata-tat-tat-pop-bang-vroom every now and then.

The new pontiff framed this historical parallel within the context of today's technological upheaval, linking his decision to what he described as ""another industrial revolution"" centred on developments in AI. ""In our own day, the Church offers to everyone the treasury of her social teaching in response to another industrial revolution and to developments in the field of artificial intelligence that pose new challenges for the defence of human dignity, justice and labour,"" Pope Leo XIV added. The Catholic Church has increasingly engaged with questions surrounding the ethical and social implications of AI. A document released by the Vatican earlier this year examined the technology's limitations and its potential to distort truth, echoing previous concerns raised by Pope Francis, who warned of AI's capacity to generate convincing but false narratives. While his predecessor set the stage for a critical engagement with AI, Pope Leo XIV's remarks suggest that the issue may become a defining theme of his papacy. ‘ব্যক্তিপর্যায়ে কিছুটা স্বস্তি দিতে এসব ব্যবস্থা বিবেচনা করা হচ্ছে।’",2025-05-11T15:30:55+06:00
https://www.thedailystar.net/tech-startup/news/top-tips-effective-workplace-communication-3891951,Top tips for effective workplace communication ,https://www.thedailystar.net/tech-startup/news/top-tips-effective-workplace-communication-3891951,"Whether you're navigating team meetings, drafting emails, or negotiating deadlines, how you communicate can make or break your professional relationships—and your reputation. But here's the thing: effective communication isn't just about 'what' you say. It's about 'how' you say it, 'when' you say it, and 'who' you're saying it to.   Before you can communicate effectively, you need to listen effectively. And no, nodding while mentally drafting your grocery list doesn't count. Active listening means fully engaging with the speaker—maintaining eye contact, asking clarifying questions, and paraphrasing their points to confirm understanding. For example, try to show support like, ""So, you're saying the project deadline moved up. How can I support the team to meet the new timeline?""   A 2024 study by Harvard Business Review outlines active listening behaviours as being positively linked to how employees perceive support from their managers, which, in turn, can lead to higher levels of job satisfaction and organisational commitment from employees. Ever sat through a rambling email or meeting that left you more confused than when you started? In a fast-paced work environment, clarity is king. Start with the bottom line—what's the key message or action item? Then, add context sparingly. For instance, instead of writing, ""I've been reviewing the data and noticed some discrepancies that might impact the quarterly report,"" try: ""The Q2 report has three data discrepancies. Let's fix them by Friday to avoid delays.""  A 2024 finding by Australian software company Atlassian found that workers waste up to 40 hours a year due to confusing emails and chats. So, save everyone time (and sanity) by trimming the unnecessary fluff.   Your CEO probably doesn't want a 10-slide deck on your lunch break ideas. Similarly, your detail-oriented teammate might panic if you gloss over specifics. Tailoring your message to your audience's preferences goes a long way.  For example, when presenting to big-picture thinkers, lead with outcomes and strategic implications, and for data lovers, provide charts, timelines, and measurable results. Try to avoid mismatched communication styles, and save time in the process. Not every conversation needs an email. Not every problem needs a meeting. Choosing the wrong medium can derail even the simplest conversations. Use this rule of thumb: for complex or sensitive topics, discuss face-to-face (or via video call);  for quick updates, use instant messaging (e.g. Slack or Teams); for documentation-heavy tasks, send an email with clear action steps.  Workplace communication isn't just about facts—it's about people. If a colleague seems stressed, acknowledge it. If a team member shares an idea, validate their effort before offering feedback. Phrases like ""I appreciate your perspective"" or ""This must feel frustrating"" go a long way in building trust.   Psychologist Daniel Goleman, author of 'Emotional Intelligence', argues that empathy is the cornerstone of effective leadership. A 2024 research paper from the International Journal of Business and Management Invention (IJBMI) backs this up, claiming that employees with higher emotional intelligence tend to report higher productivity.  Feedback isn't just about annual reviews. It's a daily opportunity to grow. When receiving feedback, avoid becoming defensive. Instead, say, ""Thank you for sharing that. Can you help me understand how I can improve?""   When giving feedback, try using the 'Situation-Behaviour-Impact (SBI)'  model:   Situation: ""In yesterday's client call…""   Behaviour: ""I noticed you interrupted my colleague several times.""   Impact: ""It made the client seem unsure about our teamwork.""   Disagreements are inevitable, but they don't have to be destructive. Focus on the issue, not the person. Instead of saying, ""You're wrong,"" try, ""I see it differently. Here's why…"" If tensions rise, propose a short break to regroup.  By separating the person from the problem, you are making it easier to avoid a wide range of possible conflicts that could arise from hurting personal sentiments, states a 2021 blog post on LinkedIn. Remember, conflict isn't the enemy—poor communication is.   Effective workplace communication isn't a talent you're born with—it's a skill you can hone. By listening actively, adapting your style, and prioritising empathy, you'll not only avoid misunderstandings but also build stronger, more collaborative relationships. So, next time you hit 'send' on an email or walk into a meeting, ask yourself: ""Is this message clear, kind, and considerate?"" Your career—and your colleagues—will thank you for it.  ‘ব্যক্তিপর্যায়ে কিছুটা স্বস্তি দিতে এসব ব্যবস্থা বিবেচনা করা হচ্ছে।’",2025-05-11T12:57:32+06:00
https://www.thedailystar.net/books-literature/news/motherhood-and-mahasweta-devis-breast-giver-3892376,On motherhood and Mahasweta Devi’s ‘Breast-Giver’,https://www.thedailystar.net/books-literature/news/motherhood-and-mahasweta-devis-breast-giver-3892376,"For all the joys and agonies of motherhood, Jashoda did not flinch from suckling 50 children. It caught on to her though, the breast cancer, and perhaps more emphatically, the social alienation with which she is met—all this after being revered as the ""Lionseated"" incarnate, that is to say, Durga (the Mother Goddess in Hindu mythology) for suckling, as a wet-nurse, 30 children who were not her own. ""When a mortal masquerades as God here below, she is forsaken by all and she must always die alone"", so the story, ""Stanadayini"" (""Breast-Giver"", 1980) by Mahasweta Devi goes. The short story is a critical imagination of motherhood—an exploration of the dynamics of oppression within which motherhood is so often embedded, particularly in the South Asian subcontinent.  Born in Dhaka, Devi (1926-2016) was a leading contemporary writer in Bangla, known as much for her political activism and grassroots work among marginalised communities of Bengal and Bihar. As for her fiction—also tinged with similar socio-political critique, and garbed in her distinctly direct yet subtle voice—roars themes of struggle and resistance in a way that somehow never feels ideologically heavy-handed. ""Breast-Giver"" narrates the struggles of a ""professional mother,"" Jashoda, a Brahmin woman driven to make ends meet by serving as a wet-nurse for the wealthy Haldar-household after an accident leaves her husband crippled. The men of the household, as well as the Mistress who runs it, acquiesce to Jashoda's role so that their own women could ""keep their bodies"" while breeding yearly as Jashoda bears the brunt of suckling their children. As a result, ""Jashoda doesn't remember at all when there was no child in her womb."" She feels empty ""without a child at the breast. Motherhood is a great addiction."" While Margaret Atwood's exemplary novel of Western feminism, The Handmaid's Tale (1985), imagines the woman's body being reduced to a breeding-vessel as a dystopia, ""Breast-Giver"" portrays how that is more of a reality than dystopia for many women in South Asia. Jashoda's extraordinary ""mammal projections"" and ""capacious breasts"" soon become objects of envy for the Haldar-household and bread-winners for her own. The part of her body, symbolically heavy with connotations of womanhood is never sexualised, rather, constantly doused in the nectar of motherhood. This, however, is no bittersweet, humane form of motherhood—but motherhood stripped to its most primitive, (concurrently glorified) biological form, as exemplified by terms such as ""mammal projections"" and analogies likening Jashoda to the divine ""Cow of Fulfillment"" of the Hindu legends. As translator Gayatri Spivak has pointed out with regard to the significance of the story's title, the author ""deliberately foregrounds the centrality of the female body in Jashoda's transactions with her clients—she is not just a 'wet-nurse,' a provider of milk, but a 'breast-giver.'"" This distinction is amplified by the grim irony that ensues—she has literally given away her breasts when her body rots and putrefies at the clasp of breast cancer. Traditional female values such as unreasoning devotion and selflessness, all embodied by Jashoda, are thus undermined as ""the self-destructive task of being mother of the world"" unfolds in the course of the narrative.  In her delusions and death-throes, Jashoda mistakes everyone for her children: ""The doctor who sees her everyday...the untouchable who will put her in the furnace, are all her milk-sons."" This again merges with divine icons of motherhood such as mother of the universe, Shakti. Jashoda herself is named for Yashoda, the mother of the beloved cowherd-child-god Krishna. These mythic allusions interweaved within the narrative, coupled with the deceptively realistic, unsentimental, matter-of-fact tone in which the tale is told, make for an enthralling concoction. At the same time, the author's scathing satire makes you laugh at the follies of characters who are representatives of a society that we are all too familiar with. Devi's critique is sharp against not only the colluding forces of patriarchy and capitalism in the exploitation of the disadvantaged but also other issues entrenched in Indian society such as caste-based discrimination, provincialism, the remnants of British colonialism, and so on. Reading ""Breast-Giver,"" I couldn't help but think of the cultural significance of the word ""ma"" in our own society today; it is lead-heavy with meaning and so frequently invoked—from commonplace addresses of tender respect for women (think of the doctor who addresses you as ma) to motherly depictions of the landscape of Bengal in artworks, songs, and films. Moreover, ""Breast-Giver"" not only underlines the socio-religious significance of motherhood in Indian society, but also the peculiar psycho-social significance—with which we may be more familiar. For example, consider the lines: ""Her [Jashoda's] mother-love wells up for Kangali as much as for her children. She wants to become the earth and feed her crippled husband and helpless children…Sages did not write of this motherly feeling of Jashoda's for her husband…Such is the power of the Indian soil that all women turn into mothers here and all men remain immersed in the spirit of holy childhood.""   The narrator then highlights the hypocrisy of educated, liberal-minded men who deny this phenomenon ""to the effect of the 'eternal she'—'Simone de Beauvoir,' et cetera"": ""It is notable that the educated Babus desire all this [only] from women outside the home"" but, inside the home, ""they want the Divine Mother in the words and conduct of the revolutionary ladies. The process is most complicated."" The narrator seals this critique with tongue-in-cheek that made me giggle: ""Because he understood this [""process""] the heroines of Saratchandra always fed the hero an extra mouthful of rice."" Saratchandra precisely catered to that elite strata of liberal male readership. Moreover, the classic trope of the wife feeding the husband rice, as a depiction of the epitome of romance, similarly runs rampant in Bengali and Bollywood films. This odd mouth-feeding fetish appears embedded within the collective psyche of our society, much like the ""belly-centered consciousness"" of Jashoda's husband. ""Jashoda's death was also the death of God,"" the story ends. I read this line as a reference to the passing of the old order and the arrival of the new, with the new Haldar daughters and granddaughters refusing to have children. Notably, Jashoda becomes all the more alienated after these in-laws start moving out and the traditional family thus breaks apart.  At the same time, ""Breast-Giver"" seems a prefiguration of and an affirmative nod to American intersectional feminist Audre Lorde's famous statements: ""the master's tools will never dismantle the master's house. They may allow us temporarily to beat him at his own game, but they will never enable us to bring about genuine change. And this fact is only threatening to those women [like Jashoda] who still define the master's house as their only source of support."" Gender norms are upturned in the story: the husband cooks and the wife works, yet the status of wage-earner does not liberate Jashoda because she relies on the ""master's"" idea of motherhood for support. Finally, seeing her decaying body, her own people stop visiting her at the hospital. To them, ""Mother meant hair in a huge topknot, blindingly white clothes, a strong personality. The person lying in the hospital is someone else, not Mother."" What does mother mean to us and how rigid or fluid is our idea of motherhood? Syeda Fatema Rahman is a writer from Dhaka, Bangladesh.

https://www.thedailystar.net/books-literature/news/ammu-reads-3892186,Ammu reads,https://www.thedailystar.net/books-literature/news/ammu-reads-3892186,"On my tenth birthday, I'd demanded—in peak Dudley fashion—that I wanted a hundred books. The first brick to build that gigantic dream library. I'd finally mastered the juktobornos and was feeling more grown up now that I'd leveled up my LadyBird colours and the teacher had given me a Peter and Jane with smaller fonts.  My father obliged, but my mother had one condition: As long as 50 of them were Bangla books, they'd take me to the bookstore. I was ecstatic. My parents, my sister, and I went down to the old Sobhanbag mosque and visited one of the little stores that neighboured the legendary Gyankosh. I was allowed free rein to explore the stacks of books on the floor and on the shelves. A man answered my father's queries from a hole in the ceiling, and dropped fat, dense, picture-less books I ignored. The books my father read had monochrome covers, no pictures, or just the head of a politician on the cover, and for as long as I can remember, he asked me to borrow ""educational books"" from the school library instead of Babysitters' Club. Naturally, I never took his advice when it came to reading.  I had stacked up a tower of books—almost all of them the thin translations of children's books from the West, and certain Bangla ones that had vanished to obscurity (though I still have a copy of Etu'r Dinosaur from this haul)—Ammu looked through the stack and suggested I buy some comics instead, pointing to the section of Diamond Comics, and specifically Pinky comics from the Chacha Choudhury universe. She insisted I would finish reading my picks within a few days. Boy, was she right. I think that was the first time I regretted not listening to my mother (this is a recurring event now). All the guests at the birthday party—my beloved extended family, who were given a preemptive booklist in case my parents refused—did their due diligence. Now I had maybe two copies of Heidi, and god knows how many Snow Whites. As Ammu predicted, I had read everything by the following weekend. My to-read list did not last the winter vacation, as I'd hoped. So, I'd begun to take my mother's book suggestions, maybe not always out of my own volition, but I rarely regretted it. She'd eased me into Shukumar Ray and Sheba Prokashoni by the time I was 12. I remember once my cousins and I passed around a copy of Noboni - Ekta Prem-er Golpo in secret and especially hidden away from my chhoto fupi, who scared us all. It disappeared a few days after I had started it; when I couldn't find it anywhere, my mother suggested Ogniroth by Samaresh Majumdar—thus, began my long love affair with Jolpaiguri. I remember going into my mother's room at intervals to ask for word meanings and just couldn't understand why this girl would be sent to the corner room once a month for six days, which launched us into the conversation on how periods are seen as unholy. I'm grateful that my mother never let me feel unholy during those days.  Noboni reappeared in the living room bookshelf the same time as she introduced me to Deepaboli from Satkahon, so I was significantly distracted. Of course, when I read Noboni later on, I understood why it was removed, and frankly, it was a semi-boring read as a young-adult.  Ammu took real charge of my reading habits when my father got us a family library card from the British Council. I was inhaling YA novels as if they were cigarettes, failing math, and forgetting to do my homework on the regular, and of course acing English classes and reading groups. I would wait for Saturdays, when Abbu would drop us off at Fuller Road on his way to whatever meetings he had. Soon, Ammu and Abbu started to take me to the blue bus full of books every Tuesday. It stood in front of Nur Masjid in Mohammadpur for two or three hours. Those books were always dog-eared, with certain pages missing or numerous scribbles in the margins in an array of handwritings. When I heard that Bishwa Shahitto Kendra suspended their mobile libraries, I thought of those afternoons in that stuffy bus and the one time with my mother passing me a battered copy of Sundarbane Saat Batsar, which I lost on a boat trip and never paid the fine for.    Throughout my school years, Ammu would assign a different writer for me to read during each vacation. The goal was to finish all the books by that author in the house, and it was always someone who wrote in Bangla. So I went through one summer vacation reading Noukadubi and a few short stories by Tagore in Chittagong, at my youngest aunt's house as she fed me aam-dudh-bhaat. During another winter vacation in our village home, I finished the entirety of Shera Satyajit and Aaro Satyajit. She objected to my exploration of certain writers, famously Humayun Ahmed since he dwelled too much on a woman's blouse button and pretty much snatched away Taslima Nasrin's Ko when she found me with it; she didn't explain why, but always offered a satisfactory alternative. It must be noted that she never threw any books away, just told me to read them when I was older. I was a good girl, so I obliged.  My mother reads way less than she used to, now that we're grown up. Her back hurts, her eyes aren't as powerful, and she has too many worldly worries to deal with. I remember when she used to forget to feed us because she'd reached a specific part of the book and didn't want to get up. She'd lie there with a pillow under her chest, and a book propped up in front of her, glasses lowered to the tip of her sharp nose and head tilted slightly upwards to accommodate the bifocals for hours. My little sister would be ordered to walk on her back before bedtime.  Life comes full circle; she's the one who gets scolded for scrolling her phone till 2 am now, and I'm the one asking everyone to limit their screen time and secretly unfollowing problematic Facebook pages from her phone the same way she hid away those books. I sanitise her newsfeed now, the way she sanitised my introduction to literature. She doesn't like that I police her online habits, but I call it literary karma.

https://www.thedailystar.net/books-literature/news/philosophical-fraternity-rabindranath-tagore-and-anwar-ibrahim-3891156,Philosophical fraternity of Rabindranath Tagore and Anwar Ibrahim,https://www.thedailystar.net/books-literature/news/philosophical-fraternity-rabindranath-tagore-and-anwar-ibrahim-3891156,"Rabindranath Tagore enjoys extensive popularity in many Asian countries outside his native Bengal and India, and his rich legacy as a poet and proponent of global dialogue and confluence of cultures is celebrated in those countries. This includes Malaysia, Singapore, and China. Rabindranath visited these countries to experience their cultures first-hand and understand their potential to engage in a constructive network of global symphony. An extensive globetrotter, he visited over 30 countries worldwide, some of them multiple times, literally spending 10 years of his life on the road as a 'chiropathik' or wayfarer, with this grand vision for humanity, and went there with his soul infused with the filaments of compassion, creativity and unity to build the bridges he needed to connect the spheres. Rabindranath visited Malaysia and Singapore (British Malaya) in July-August 1927. During this visit, he spent five days in Singapore and 21 days in Malaysia. He described his visit as a ""pilgrimage"" as he wanted to see the interaction of cultures in these societies–Malay, Chinese, Indian, and local tribal traditions–and to comprehend this unity in diversity better, he not only mingled with them freely but also stayed with Muslim, Chinese and Indian families. Moreover, he gave lectures and addresses touching on his core mission of creating a manab mahajati or global community of humanity that transcends national and cultural boundaries.  According to the Nalanda-Sriwijaya Centre at the Institute of Southeast Asian Studies, Singapore, he spoke on topics such as ""International Friendship and the Unity of Mankind"" (July 22), ""Cultural Fellowship between Chinese and Indians"" (July 24), ""Unity of the Human Race"" (August 4) and ""Uniting the Cultures of India and China in Service of the Whole World"" (August 5). In one of the events, Rabindranath was introduced by C.H. Woolfe, the Acting Colonial Secretary, as ""one of the world's greatest men."" In Malacca, a Muslim admirer proclaimed, ""Tagore was not only a poet of the highest calibre but by the grace of Khudatallah had also attained tassawuf or enlightenment of a Sufi mystic."" The poet-emperor was greeted enthusiastically by all the local communities. This visit, almost a century ago, and his vision of hope for Asia and the world have endeared him to many Malaysians but to none more than the Honourable Dato' Seri Anwar bin Ibrahim, the country's Prime Minister. In a commemorative message to Rabindranath's centenary celebration in 1961, Malaysia's first Prime Minister, Tunku Abdul Rahman, described Rabindranath as a poet who ""belongs to Asia and the world"" and whose spiritually couched humanitarian philosophy continues to act as ""an enriching source of inspiration to mankind."" However, Anwar's admiration for the Bengal bard goes far beyond. In his seminal book, The Asian Renaissance (1996), Anwar proffers Rabindranath, Filipino writer and polymath Jose Rizal and Pakistani poet Muhammad Iqbal as ""progenitors and early protagonists of the Asian Renaissance."" He believes that these three creative thinkers and cultural icons have led a rejuvenation of the Asian self, deformed and fractured by the depraved, marauding colonial rule, with a humanistic tradition and an Asian model of universalism laced with noble sensibility, moral well-being, imagination, compassion, equity and spirituality that challenges and excels the greed oriented globalisation disguising imperialism that has come from the West.  Anwar's intellectual breadth is truly remarkable, making him one of the most learned leaders in the modern world. In Makers of Contemporary Islam (2001), John Esposito and John Voll regard Anwar as one of the nine most internationally visible and influential intellectual activists in the Muslim world who have catalysed an Islamic revival through their ""effective synthesis of modernisation and Islamic tradition.""  However, Anwar is also well versed in Shakespeare and the Western tradition. He has drunk aplenty from the Chinese, Malay and Indian intellectual wells, too. He acquired much of this erudition during his decade-long prison for politically motivated charges. As he once said in his characteristic humour, he filled his loneliness in jail by ""singing songs and reading."" He talked about his ""singing repertoire"" in his Time Magazine interview on September 19, 2024 and showcased his singing talent by performing a classic Hindi song during his recent visit to India. As for his reading habit in prison, he maintained during his visit to Australia in March 2024 that the works of William Shakespeare helped him behind bars: ""I read and reread Shakespeare [in prison] … [and] saw it differently. I saw not only the brilliance but the moral fortitude. Be it Othello, with the racism, or King Lear, with Cordelia towards the end.""  Anwar's prison experience has also given him the fortitude to fight for the minorities and marginalised communities at home and abroad. Much like Rabindranath, it has made him inclusive and pluralistic in imagination, an essential component of his vision of the Asian Renaissance.  Throughout his life, Rabindranath fought for the rights of Muslims, women and the Untouchables. He wanted India to forge ""a great synthesis"" of its diverse socio-cultural-religious forces through the cultivation of a spirit of tolerance, mutuality, unity and empathy – that which helps to ""bridge over the differences of colours and scriptures and … recognise all that is highest and best as the common heritage of humanity.""  Similarly, Anwar has fought for the economically and racially deprived in Malaysia in the spirit of ""Malaysia Madani,"" or a Civil Malaysia that is more humanistic and inclusive. He believes that a new world order rooted in multiculturalism and pluralism is possible only if a nation like Malaysia, which he considers ""Asia in microcosm,"" can rebuff racial and religious extremism and espouse moderation. Thus, in his 2023 budget speech, Anwar warned, ""The harmony and unity of our nation must always be preserved, regardless of religion or race...This country will not allow [the] hateful sentiment [of bigotry] to grow."" He also allocated funds in the budget for projects to cultivate diversity and bridge divides.  In his essay ""Race Conflict,"" Rabindranath asserts that the problem of race conflict has been ""the highest problem of human history."" Nonetheless, he focused more on religious unity in his work because of the ongoing religious conflict between Hindus and Muslims that eventually split the subcontinent. Rabindranath believed India, Asia and the world could never unite without religious harmony. Therefore, to dispel religious hostility and to induce interreligious harmony, he established an Islamic Studies Department (1927), a Chair of Persian Studies (1932), a Chinese Studies Department (1937) and a research centre for the study of the all the major religions at his university, Visva-Bharati. Likewise, Anwar emphasises religious cooperation and harmony as pivotal to his universalist vision. Therefore, he rejects religious extremism by quoting a hadith in his 2023 budget speech, ""Those who go to extremes are doomed."" He also underscores the shared heritage of all the religions in his book, The Asian Renaissance and his interviews and speeches. For example, in the ""Sapru House Lecture"" in India, 2024, he proclaims: ""Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs, Jains, Jews, Christians, Buddhists–we share histories and origins. We share sources of knowledge and in that common treasury of memories, we vindicate our shared values of truth, of ethics, of humanity and of our innate desire for peace."" Rabindranath was fiercely critical of Western materialism, its ""cold-blooded utilitarianism,"" self-seeking nationalism and ""barbaric greed."" Yet he believed that East-West harmony was crucial, as without it, the world would remain insular and fractured: ""to say that it is wrong to cooperate with the West is to encourage the worst form of provincialism and can produce nothing but the worst form of indigence."" However, Rabindranath wanted this cooperation ""in fullness of truth."" Anwar, too, is critical of Western hegemony, hypocrisy and arrogance but advocates East-West symbiosis, not through Europhilia or senseless submission to the West, but in equal partnership and without sacrificing the core values of justice, virtue and compassion, which he deems both Asian and universal. He believes in global dialogue and consortium of cultures because, without them, there cannot be ""global convivencia."" He maintains that Asia must learn from ""Western civilisation, inasmuch as the West has to learn from the East,"" but that encounter ought to be ""between equals… that will serve to challenge our pride and end our prejudices."" In a lecture in China in 1924, Rabindranath proclaimed, ""I hope that some dreamer will spring from among you and preach a message of love and therewith, overcoming all differences, bridge the chasm of passions which has been widening for ages."" Anwar has emerged as that messenger for our time. Both hold that while human beings should continue to love members of their community, race, religion and nation, their love should not be circumscribed by any arbitrary ""circle,"" or thorny hedges of exclusion or division but extend to the rest of humankind. If a nation is an imaginary circle, they argue, it is incumbent upon us to readjust our imagination so that the fellowship of the species does not stop at a geographical border like commodities. By adopting this inclusive vision, it is possible to create a commonwealth of nations where every nation has its identity and yet remains an integral part of the larger global community through the invisible bond of fellowship and fraternity.   Mohammad A.

https://www.thedailystar.net/books-literature/news/the-sacred-architecture-story-3890281,The sacred architecture of story,https://www.thedailystar.net/books-literature/news/the-sacred-architecture-story-3890281,"Faiqa Mansab's second novel, The Sufi Storyteller, is a quiet triumph—both elegiac and urgent, intimate and expansive. It arrives as a natural evolution from her acclaimed debut, This House of Clay and Water (Penguin Random House India, 2017), and yet it stands apart, not merely in ambition but in execution. Where the former was steeped in the politics of desire and gender within Lahore's elite and unseen spaces, The Sufi Storyteller ventures across continents and metaphysical thresholds to bring forth something more elusive: the sacred, storied terrain of the inner world. The novel traces the entwined journeys of Layla, a scholar of women's histories in a small American liberal arts college, and Mira, a Sufi storyteller bearing the weight of a terrible past. A woman's murder becomes the axis upon which the narrative turns but this is no ordinary mystery. The crime is a disturbance, a crack in the carefully composed surfaces of both women's lives, through which memory, story, and sorrow begin to leak and, eventually, flood.  Mansab's feminism here is not polemical. It is textured and spiritually aware. In Layla and Mira, she gives us women shaped by grief, marked by exile, both geographic and emotional and yet capable of immense compassion, complexity, and transformation. These are not heroines molded for clarity; they are rendered in chiaroscuro, in shadows and contradiction. At the heart of the novel is a profound meditation on the act of storytelling itself. Mira, whose voice carries the cadences of oral tradition, represents the instinctive, intuitive knowledge passed down through generations of women, mystics, and keepers of the unsaid. Layla, in contrast, approaches stories through the lens of research and archival authority. It is this tension between text and telling, history and memory, intellect, and emotion that Mansab renders with delicate nuance. Her prose is lyrical, spacious, and deliberate. It evokes the tempo of Sufi narrative. There is repetition that deepens rather than dilutes, silences that echo, and imagery that unfolds like a dervish's dance: circular, layered, and revelatory. The ""realm of story"" that Layla and Mira enter is not merely symbolic; it is crafted with mythic resonance, a liminal space where past and present, dream and trauma, are interlaced like threads in a Sufi's robe. In many ways, the novel resists Western narrative conventions. Its emotional crescendos do not coincide with plot twists; rather, they emerge from moments of recognition, from fragments of stories buried within stories. The murder mystery, though present, serves more as a structural whisper than a genre anchor. What unfolds instead is a deeply feminist excavation of the silences within women's lives, the silences they inherit, absorb, and sometimes choose to carry. Mansab's feminism here is not polemical. It is textured and spiritually aware. In Layla and Mira, she gives us women shaped by grief, marked by exile, both geographic and emotional and yet capable of immense compassion, complexity, and transformation. These are not heroines molded for clarity; they are rendered in chiaroscuro, in shadows and contradiction. There is also something remarkably generous in the novel's embrace of Sufi thought, not merely as a backdrop but as an epistemology, a way of knowing and being. The Sufi parables that flow through the text serve as both metaphor and method. They are not neatly decipherable; rather, they are offerings. This refusal to over-explain, to smooth the reader's path, is one of the book's greatest strengths. It invites surrender rather than control. Compared to This House of Clay and Water, this novel is more ambitious in scope but also more refined in its craft. The voice is quieter, more assured. The characters are less constrained by place and more in dialogue with timeless questions of self, truth, and forgiveness. Yet the thematic threads remain: the body and its discontents, the power of voice, the haunting presence of the unsaid. The world Mansab conjures is lush with metaphor, but it is also grounded in the visceral. A woman's death, a note from a killer, a journey into war-ravaged mountains, these are not abstractions but anchors, gestures toward how violence inscribes itself upon language, memory, and gendered experience. In The Sufi Storyteller, Faiqa Mansab offers a novel that is not only about story but made of story, its fragments, its echoes, its capacity to both wound and mend. It is a deeply literary work, one that asks for patience, reflection, and above all, listening. For in this world, it is not the loudest voice that reveals the truth, but the one that has endured the longest silence.

Feluda came to us gently. Wrapped in brown paper, or worn from many reads—and once found, he stayed. There was Topshe, too. The cousin, the chronicler, the quiet witness to brilliance. We didn't just admire him; many of us longed to be him. To be that trusted companion, that chosen one who gets to walk beside someone who could deduce a man's secrets from the way he stirred his tea. To board a train to Jaisalmer or trail through ancient ruins in Lucknow, to chase riddles that turned ordinary days into adventures. In our own way, we all wanted to crack a code, spot a clue, chase the thrill of something larger than life. But as we grew older, the lens shifted. The nostalgia remained, but so did the questions. Slowly, quietly, we began to read the silences too—the gaps, the absences, the shadows. Detective fiction, by its very nature, has always been a well-tailored, pipe-smoking boys' club. When the average reader imagines a sleuth, the mind's eye conjures up a man; sharp, cerebral, and sartorially sound.Be it Sherlock Holmes, Byomkesh Bakshi, or Satyajit Ray's iconic Feluda. The genre's gendered legacy is hard to miss: Even as Agatha Christie's Miss Marple or Suchitra Bhattacharya's Mitin Mashi made their marks, they remained mostly outliers in a landscape dominated by men draped in trench coats and deductive prowess. The Bangali literary world, in particular, has long reserved its detective pedestal for the likes of Feluda, Kakababu, Kiriti Roy, or Byomkesh, while early female detectives like Krishna (penned by Prabhabati Devi Saraswati) never quite cracked the mainstream. It is against this backdrop that the absence of women in Feluda's world becomes not just a narrative quirk but a telling reflection of the cultural and social codes of the Bangali bhadralok. Feluda-Pradosh C. Mitter arrived on the scene in 1965, and over the course of 35 published stories (with four unpublished), he became the very embodiment of the educated, urbane, morally upright Bangali gentleman. His world is scrupulously constructed: We know about his father, his uncles, and the paternal lineages of both Feluda and his cousin Topshe, the narrator. Yet, when it comes to the women in their lives, the silence is deafening. The only mention of Feluda's mother is a single line: He lost her at the age of nine. Topshe's mother, too, is a ghostly absence—no emotional shading, no narrative presence, not even a passing comment. This is not a matter of oversight. As Ray's aunt, the celebrated author Leela Majumdar, wryly noted in her essay, ""Felu Chand"" (Sandesh, December 1995): ""…There's something rather odd, you know, in Feluchand's stories and novels. Yes, why is it that we never see any family members or relatives of the detective and his assistant? Even the homes of the villains seem to have no one except servants!"" The critique is as sharp as it is accurate. For a series that revels in the minutiae of Bangali life, the absence of mothers, aunts, and sisters is not just noticeable.It's apparent. Of course, there are exceptions, but they are rare and fleeting. In ""Gosainpur Sargaram"" (Sandesh, Sharadiya 1383) and Jahangirer Swarnamudra (Sandesh, Sharadiya 1819), elderly women briefly influence the plot. ""Chhinnamastar Abhishap"" (Desh, Sharadiya 1385) introduces Neelima Devi, who aids Feluda's investigation, while in ""Ambar Sen Antardhan Rahasya"" (Anandamela, 1983), Mrs Sen and her daughter provide crucial clues. In ""Shakuntalar Kanthahaar"" and ""D Munshir Diary"", female characters are central to the mystery's resolution—Mrs Munshi's actions, for instance, are pivotal to the case. But these appearances are rare and lack continuity. These women; wives, daughters, or informants—may serve the story in isolated moments, but they are never part of the core world. They do not return, they are not remembered, and they are never central. What catches the reader's attention, over time, is not the total absence, but the absence of continuity. Yet, these women are supporting actors in a drama where the spotlight remains firmly on the male trio: Feluda, Topshe, and Lalmohan Ganguly (Jatayu). There is no recurring female character, no female foil or confidante. The adventures, camaraderie, and even the banter are resolutely male. This narrative architecture is no accident. It is deeply tied to the ethos of the bhadralok, a term that has shaped the Bengali psyche for over two centuries. The bhadralok (literally ""gentleman"")—emerged in 19th century colonial Bengal as a social class defined by education, English proficiency, and a genteel, ""civilised"" lifestyle. They were the torchbearers of the so-called Bangali Renaissance, the intermediaries of the empire, and the self-appointed custodians of culture and taste. As Partha Chatterjee observes, the bhadralok identity was less about birth and more about acquiring a ""language of respectability and a genteel lifestyle that is, as it were, nobody's patrimony, but one that each person has to acquire through learning in order to become bhadra"". But this respectability came at a cost. The bhadralok project was built on a strict division between the public and private spheres—a division that mapped neatly onto gender. Men were the rational actors, the seekers of truth, the explorers of the world; women, by contrast, were relegated to the home, the keepers of tradition and spirituality. Partha Chatterjee, in his seminal essay ""The Nationalist Resolution of the Women's Question"", explained that the ""ghar"" (home) and ""bahir"" (outside) dichotomy is at play here: ""On the material level, the West served as a blueprint. But on the spiritual level, there occurred a classicisation of tradition…the West continued its dominance while on the level of problematic, in the sphere of specific cultural and social contexts, ancient records and texts were invoked in order to reform Hindu morality and sexuality that was deemed fit for the 19th century"". In Feluda's meticulously ordered universe, this separation is absolute. The detective's world is one of logic, mobility, and public engagement—spaces from which women are conspicuously, and perhaps intentionally, excluded. Ray himself was acutely aware of this absence and addressed it directly. In a note for a Feluda collection that was published in 1988, he wrote, ""To write a whodunit while keeping in mind a young readership is not an easy task, because the stories have to be kept 'clean'. No illicit love, no crime of passion, and only a modicum of violence. I hope adult readers will bear this in mind when reading these stories."" While Ray's candour is admirable, his rationale inadvertently exposes a deeper bhadralok anxiety: the notion that the mere presence of women threatens the narrative's ""cleanliness"" or innocence. But as literary history has shown through characters like Miss Marple or Mitin Mashi; female presence need not imply sexualisation or moral ambiguity.  This unintentional suggestion, that female presence is somehow entangled with moral complexity, impurity, or adult content—speaks volumes about the norms of his time. Yet, this is precisely where Ray's brilliance could have defied convention. In a literary landscape where women were routinely sidelined in detective fiction, a writer as versatile and imaginative as Ray could have shaped a narrative that included strong, witty female characters without compromising the clarity or sophistication of his stories. Far from ""unclean,"" such inclusion would have expanded the imaginative scope of his readers, especially young girls, and offered them a different kind of mirror. It would not only have reflected the intellect and agency of women but also widened the very idea of who belongs in a world of clues, codes, and conclusions. This absence is not just a reflection of genre or audience. It is a window into the anxieties and aspirations of the bhadralok class—a class that defined itself by its intellectual and moral superiority, its disdain for the ""chhotolok"" (the uncultured masses), and its ability to keep the messy realities of sexuality and domesticity at bay. As Sayandeb Chowdhury notes, ""Feluda's world is not just a boys' club; it is a carefully curated masculine enclave, insulated from the ambiguities and entanglements of female subjectivity."" As Partha Chatterjee argues, the bhadralok identity hinges on a bifurcation of the ""spiritual"" (domestic, feminine) and ""material"" (public, masculine) spheres. Feluda's all-male universe, devoid of domesticity or female influence, becomes a literary manifestation of this divide—a detective who solves mysteries not just for justice, but to uphold the bhadralok's self-image as the enlightened guardian of Bangali modernity. Interestingly, there is a noticeable dissonance between Ray's comments on limiting gender presence in the Feluda stories and his cinematic practice. Films like Charulata (1964), Devi (1960), and Mahanagar (1963) reflect his deep sensitivity toward women's inner lives and societal struggles. Even in his adaptations of Feluda for the screen, Ray introduced female characters absent from the original texts, like Dakshinaranjan's mother in Sonar Kella (1974) and the female bhajan singer in Joy Baba Felunath (1979), likely recognising the expectations of a broader, more adult audience. These decisions hint at an implicit belief that certain genres or readerships require the exclusion of certain genders, whether due to artistic limitations, market considerations, or adherence to established genre conventions. It reveals not just a narrative strategy, but a cultural positioning: a scepticism, perhaps, of the wider expectations of detective fiction at the time. Written primarily for Sandesh, a children's magazine, Satyajit Ray tailored these stories to young readers, and naturally, the social norms of that era shaped much of what was included and what was left out. While today's readers may notice the silences or limited representations, it's essential to read these works with an understanding of their historical and cultural moment. Yet, given Ray's brilliance and sensitivity across his works, one might still wonder if the Feluda stories could have offered a slightly more inclusive imagination. That critique doesn't diminish the charm; it enriches it. In revisiting what's missing, we see not only how far we've come but how timeless stories can invite timeless questions. That such hopes exist is perhaps the greatest compliment to the legacy Satyajit Ray leaves behind.   Mahmuda Emdad is a women and gender studies major with an endless interest in feminist writings, historical fiction, and pretty much everything else, all while questioning the world in the process.

According to the Pulitzer website, Toha was awarded for his essays ""on the physical and emotional carnage in Gaza that combine deep reporting with the intimacy of memoir to convey the Palestinian experience of more than a year and a half of war with Israel."" The essays published in The New Yorker include ""Requiem for a Refugee Camp"", ""The Gaza We Leave Behind"", ""The Pain of Travelling While Palestinian"", and ""My Family's Daily Struggle to Find Food in Gaza.""

https://www.thedailystar.net/books-literature/news/bengali-buddha-blighty-3885331,A Bengali Buddha in Blighty,https://www.thedailystar.net/books-literature/news/bengali-buddha-blighty-3885331,"Pride of place above the fireplace in the sitting room of our little house in distant Blighty is a painting from North Bengal. It is of the Buddha, an image dating from before the time of the coming of Islam to Bengal when, during the Pala dynasty, great centres of Buddhist learning flourished at sites such as Paharpur, then Somapura. Sitting on the mantelpiece below the Buddha are half a dozen ceramic monkeys sculpted by an artist from Madhubani schooled in Shantiniketan: arms outstretched, the banara lok are searching for the kidnapped Sita. To either side of this central fireplace are shelves stacked with books. This library includes a huge family Bible, Mohammad Marmaduke Pickthall's explanatory translation of the glorious Qur'an and the Bhagavad Gita. Beyond these sacred scriptures extend the profane, ranging from the seminal works of Sir William Jones (longtime resident of Bengal interred in Kolkata) to those of Kaiser Haq on the topicalities of Greenland and the streets of Dhaka. As for art, besides the thangka of the Buddha and the glazed monkeys, there are colourful paintings and sculptures of the mischievous Krishna and several of my wife Rani's watercolours of idyllic Indian pastoral scenes. An assortment of easy chairs and much other bric-à-brac lend comfort to this cosy sitting-room. Pleasant as this refuge may be, it begs the question of where in all these possessions the truth of life may lie. Does one need all these books? My father had few books: not many beyond Shakespeare, Dickens and Boswell's Johnson. My maternal grandmother's legacy was just that one big family Bible, names inscribed inside, together with an equally weighty copy of John Bunyan's allegorical guide on how to live a dutiful Christian life, The Pilgrim's Progress (1678).  How many books does anyone really need? Where is wisdom to be found? As the philosophers ask: Is the One to be found in the many or the many to be found in the One? The Qur'an would no doubt be ""the one book"" sufficient for many pious folk in Bangladesh as the Bible was for my grandmother. Some have questioned what need there is for commentaries on such divinely-revealed texts? What need of commentators or interpreters: scholars, imams, priests? Others, going further, ask 'what need of any books at all, however sacred and seminal?' Is it not, as the practices of the Sufis and Vaishnava Bhaktins of Bengal have suggested, that truth is to be found, if not in the mind through meditation, in the depths of the human heart?  And as for books, so for images, whether paintings or sculptures, to say nothing of photographs and those selfies that epitomise the headlong rush into irrelevance of a consumer society. At various times in history the two later religions of the Book have both adopted the original Judaeic prescription banning graven images.  Islam's traditional prohibition on representational art is well-known but a similar concern has also surfaced in Christianity. In 8th century Byzantium–later Constantinople and finally Istanbul–there was a mighty struggle between the Iconoclasts and the Iconodules of the Orthodox Church, those who would destroy sacred images as profane distractions and those who advocated their devotional value.  With the rise of Protestantism in 16th and 17th century England, the Puritans quite literally attacked Roman Catholic ""idolatry"", engaging in the systematic smashing of the stained-glass windows of churches and of any and all paintings and statues depicting religious figures. The windows they replaced, if at all, with clear glass. Some, abandoning chapels altogether, gathered to worship under yew and oak trees in the open fields. So where does all this leave the Bengali painting of the Buddha above our fireplace? Years ago, on account of my wife being an exotic Indian visitor, it was given to her by a Dominican monk in a monastery in Avila in Spain, a city once under Muslim rule and later the home of the Christian mystic, Teresa. The iconic painting, though badly water stained, has materially survived its wanderings in various hands through various lands but what, if anything, has survived of its spiritual significance? With one crucial difference, the painting resembles the many familiar images there are of the Buddha, the enlightened–or disillusioned–one, in a state of meditation or trance. The difference is that seated in the lap of this–indigo blue coloured–Buddha is the white image of a female Shakti in an apparently perfect position of or for sexual congress. If Buddha represents the principle of absolute quiescence, śunyata or ""emptiness"", detachment from the desires of life, Shakti represents that of energy and life in all its fullness. The two are perfectly if paradoxically reconciled or fused in this Tantric image that, make of it what you will, is designed to expand the mind.  Meditate for a moment on this blissful image of the Bengali Buddha and it promises or threatens to transform or supplant the domestic scene over which it presides. If we had to imagine a close counterpart, even embodiment, in contemporary Bangladesh would it not be the figure of the baul, wandering the byways free of the desire for household possessions, the devotional songs he sings a manifestation of his inseparable Shakti?  John Drew is author of  India and the Romantic Imagination (Oxford India).

You look over and see him standing by the window but looking into the room, scanning the room. Maybe he will shut up soon you think and close your eyes, bringing your knees up to your chest to lean your head on them. No one has any energy to reply. I place my hand on your shoulder and lightly push down, enough to wake you but hopefully not startle you. There is enough to be jumpy about and waking up from a nap doesn't need to be another one. I get no response. I move my hand on your cotton t-shirt, just my fingertips making contact. You take in a sharp breath, I see your head move on your knees and you slowly move your head. I walk over to the window and find him lay on the ground, his t-shirt wrapped into a ball under his head. A smart makeshift pillow on this stone floor, actually doubly smart as it also increases the skin contact with the cool floor. I do the same thing I did to you and that is enough to startle him. I sit against an empty wall. You break the silence with your observation that we should try to get out of this house as soon as possible. It didn't need to be said because we've all been thinking and saying it for half a day now. None of us know how to do what you suggested as we look at each other in silence once again. You move your hand over the floor collecting the dirt between your fingertips and spread it across them making circular patterns. This ritual seems to be the most important thing happening to all of us. You gaze past your fingers and the floor as you repeat the action. I look at you as you continue to do this. He is hovering against the window again but mesmerised by the movement of your right hand. ""What if we jump? It's only the first floor and I am sure we won't really be hurt? A few scrapes and cuts maybe but nothing broken…nothing serious…nothing compared to…"" his voice trailed off, his eyes still fixed on your fingers.  You walk over to the window and open it all the way. It's one of those that open all the way so there is no need to break it and create a hazard in the landing area, finally some luck. He helps you onto the ledge as I ease myself up and walk towards you. You look at me before closely your eyes and letting out a sigh saying, ""I hate flying cockroaches"" as you let go.

The voluntary organisation of Chattogram based professionals, town planners, and civil society members made the demand at a press conference at Chattogram Pres Club yesterday. While reading out a written statement, Architect Zarina Hossain said the old Chattogram Circuit House and the adjoining 3.89 acres area of open spacious ground had long been an open gathering centre for social, cultural and political activities of Chattogram. The open space was destroyed through erecting boundary wall and structures following an unexpected decision taken by the then Chittagong City Corporation (CCC) in 1993 to lease it out commercially, she said. It is to be noted that the land is owned by the defence ministry. The ministry gave no objection when the CCC in 1992 wanted to build a children's park at the space and leased out to a private firm for 25 years. In 2024, Chattogram district administration demolished the children's park. Zarina stated that when the Chattogram district administration demolished the unplanned structures, the dwellers of the port city were excited to get the open space. After the demolition, the administration assured of keeping the ground open for all, she said. But very recently a direction claiming ownership of the premise has been witnessed while public entrance has also been restricted at this free space, said Zarina expressing her concern. She said this ground, an important landmark of the city, remained as an open space for all since the very beginning of establishment of the city. Mentioning that there are very limited open spaces in the port city, she demanded that no structure is built on the ground and to turn it as an open courtyard for all citizen. Veteran educationist Professor Sikandar Khan, also president of the organisation, said, ""From our childhood we have seen this ground as an open public space where people of all ages used to visit."" He demanded for keeping the ground open for all. Engineer ABMA Baset, Architect Ahmed Zillur Chowdhury, former Chittagong Port Authority (CPA) Member Md Zafar Alam, Professor Monzurul Kibria were present at the press conference among others. ‘ব্যক্তিপর্যায়ে কিছুটা স্বস্তি দিতে এসব ব্যবস্থা বিবেচনা করা হচ্ছে।’",2025-05-13T00:57:04+06:00
