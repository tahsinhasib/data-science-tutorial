A vehicle with Khaleda seated in the front seat, while her two daughters-in-law occupied the rear seats, left the airport around 11:15am and reached her house, Firoza, around 1:25pm amid tight security measures. A Qatari royal air ambulance carrying Khaleda and her entourage landed at Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport at 10:42am, said BNP Media Cell member Sayrul Kabir Khan. Khaleda returned home after nearly four months of advanced treatment in London, while Zubaida returned, ending her 17-year exile in London. Meanwhile, BNP Secretary General Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir, along with several senior party leaders, welcomed Khaleda at the airport. The special air ambulance, provided by Qatar’s Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, departed Heathrow Airport at around 9:35pm on Monday, carrying Khaleda and her entourage. It reached Dhaka after a stopover in Qatar. The leaders and activists of the BNP and its associate bodies welcomed her, standing along the footpaths stretching from Airport Road to Gulshan Avenue to greet their beloved leader and party chief. BNP supporters began assembling along both sides of the nearly 10-kilometre route from early morning, holding national and party flags to welcome Khaleda on her return. Khaleda Zia had travelled to London on January 8 in a special air ambulance sent by the Emir of Qatar. Upon arrival, she was admitted to the London Clinic, a private hospital, where she remained under the care of renowned specialists Professor Patrick Kennedy and Professor Jennifer Cross for 17 days. Since 25 January, she had been receiving treatment at the residence of her elder son, Tarique Rahman. Following her discharge from the London Clinic, she continued her recovery under the supervision of Professors Kennedy and Cross at Tarique Rahman’s residence. Her residence ‘Firoza’ located at House 1, Road 80, was fully prepared to welcome her. Upon her return, stringent security measures were observed around Khaleda’s residence. Members of the armed forces, along with law enforcement agencies, were deployed to ensure her safety. On Tuesday morning, the road in front of Firoza was seen closed to vehicular traffic, with only limited pedestrian access. A tight security perimeter was established by law enforcement officials. The premises had been thoroughly cleaned and decorated with flower pots in the garden, and utilities such as electricity, gas, and water supplies were checked, according to Sayrul Kabir Khan. Surrounded by high walls, the residence features a security room at the entrance, where members of the police and the Chairperson’s Security Force (CSF) are stationed in shifts to ensure round-the-clock security. Sayrul noted that all rooms inside the house had been cleaned, with the front garden decorated with flower pots, adding a touch of colour and warmth in anticipation of her arrival.",NA

After that, we will be able to enter the second phase, which will begin soon,” he said while presiding over a discussion with the National Citizen Party (NCP) at the LD Hall of the Jatiya Sangsad Bhaban. A four-member NCP delegation, led by its member secretary Akhtar Hossain, joined the talks with the National Consensus Commission on the second day of discussions. At the outset of the meeting, the NCP submitted its outlines for fundamental reforms to the National Consensus Commission. Akhtar Hossain handed over the document to Prof Ali Riaz. “We are advancing discussions with political parties both formally and informally. Through this process, we are trying to formulate a National Charter that aims to outline the path to establishing a democratic state in the future,” Prof Riaz said. He noted that the reform outlines submitted by the NCP would certainly assist in drafting the National Charter. The NCP delegation also included its chief organizer for the northern region, Sarjis Alam, and Joint Conveners Sarwar Tushar and Jabed Rasin. Members of the Consensus Commission—Safar Raj Hossain, Justice Emdadul Haque, Dr Badiul Alam Majumdar, Dr Iftekharuzzaman, and Dr Mohammad Ayub Miah—were present at the discussion, which was moderated by the Chief Adviser’s Special Assistant, Monir Haider. The meeting is part of a series of dialogues with political parties aimed at building a national consensus on state reform initiatives undertaken by the interim government. Earlier, on April 18, the NCP participated in discussions with the commission. The party had also submitted its written opinions on the reform recommendations on March 24. The National Consensus Commission launched its dialogue series with political parties on March 20, aiming to develop a united stance on the interim government's reform efforts. So far, the commission has held discussions with 25 political parties. The commission, formed under the leadership of Chief Adviser Professor Muhammad Yunus, has been working since February 15, 2025, to finalize its recommendations for crucial state reforms.",NA

Meanwhile, BNP Secretary General Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir, along with several senior party leaders, arrived at the airport around 8:30am to receive Khaleda. Talking to reporters at the airport, Fakhrul expressed the hope that the return of party chairperson Begum Khaleda Zia would facilitate the restoration and advancement of democracy in the country. “She went abroad for treatment after years of suffering under fascist oppression. With the fall of fascism, she was finally able to receive proper medical care. After nearly four months of treatment, she is returning home today. It's a matter of great joy for us and the people,” said the BNP leader. The special air ambulance, provided by Qatar’s Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, departed Heathrow Airport at around 9:35pm on Monday, carrying Khaleda and her entourage.

BNP supporters began assembling along both sides of the nearly 10-kilometre route since early morning, holding national and party flags to greet Khaleda on her return. Earlier on Monday, Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir had urged everyone not to stand on the road in any manner. “Those wishing to welcome Madam should stand on the footpath and greet her from there. We have instructed that party leaders and activists may hold national and BNP flags while receiving her,” he said. He urged party members to remain vigilant and avoid causing traffic congestion while welcoming the BNP chief, as an SSC examination is scheduled for Tuesday. Dhaka Metropolitan Police (DMP) also issued a notice on Monday, warning of potential traffic congestion in the Gulshan-Banani area due to excessive crowds gathering to welcome Khaleda. It also released a set of parking guidelines for the vehicles of journalists and arriving guests to ensure public safety and minimise disruption to city traffic.

Tarique, Dr Zubaida, and their daughter Zaima Rahman have been living in London since 2008. After 17 years in exile, Dr Zubaida Rahman also returned home with her mother-in-law, intending to stay at her father’s residence in Dhanmondi. Her father’s house, known as Mahbub Bhaban, located on Road 5 of Dhanmondi, has also been prepared to receive Zubaida. Although the house is well-maintained, additional arrangements have been made to ensure Zubaida’s comfort and security. Officials from the police and intelligence agencies have already inspected the property and outlined necessary security measures, as the BNP wrote to the Inspector General of Police requesting armed protection, a police presence at the residence, and the installation of an archway scanner, citing potential security threats to her.",NA

NCP Member Secretary Akhtar Hossain handed the outlines to National Consensus Commission Vice Chairman Prof Ali Riaz at the outset of a dialogue at the LD Hall of the Jatiya Sangsad Complex. A four-member NCP delegation, led by Akhtar Hossain, joined the talks with the National Consensus Commission for the second day. The discussion started at 10:40am with Prof Ali Riaz in the chair. Speaking at the function, Akhtar said that the fundamental reforms must reflect three basic issues: balance of power, accountability, and decentralization. “Fundamental reforms do not mean reforming the electoral system or constitutional reform based on a two-thirds majority in parliament. Rather, achieving these three things—balance of power, accountability, and decentralization—these are the main foundations of fundamental reforms,” he said. Regarding the fundamental reforms, Akhtar said: “To achieve that, we need to find out how we can free ourselves from the authoritarian and fascist elements in the constitutional and state structures; how we can reflect the national interest by going beyond political considerations in the appointment of constitutional posts; how we can free the judiciary from politics and present it as a true symbol of justice. We consider each of these issues to be included in fundamental reforms.” He said that the people of Bangladesh have been oppressed and persecuted due to the governance structure through which the country has been governed over the past 53 years, and due to the authoritarian and fascist elements that have remained in the state structure. The NCP member secretary added that the students and people of Bangladesh sacrificed their lives in the July uprising in an effort to discover how to free the constitution and state structure from authoritarian and fascist elements, in a bid to lead the country towards a democratic state. Akhtar said that NCP placed the proposals for fundamental reforms so that Bangladesh can integrate itself into the path of democratic elevation, instead of remaining trapped in the authoritarian and fascist structure of the past. The NCP delegation members included its Chief Organizer (northern region) Sarjis Alam, and Joint Conveners Sarwar Tushar and Jabed Rasin.

https://www.dhakatribune.com///www.dhakatribune.com/opinion/op-ed/380476/the-woes-of-entrepreneurs-in-bangladesh,The woes of entrepreneurs in Bangladesh,https://www.dhakatribune.com///www.dhakatribune.com/opinion/op-ed/380476/the-woes-of-entrepreneurs-in-bangladesh,"Entrepreneurship in Bangladesh begins with a vision and then entails surviving through endurance What does it take to become a successful entrepreneur in the country?  We have a lot of stories where people have risen as top entrepreneurs braving insurmountable odds. We now have successful entrepreneurs in the fields of manufacturing, consumer goods, asset development, health services, and many other fields.  There are a few who are multitalented and have ventured into a host of businesses covering a wider domain of multidisciplinary activities.  They are the ones who didn't settle for a petty job or small business of buying and selling. Rather, with enviable energy and indomitable courage to take risks, they explore their area of choice to invest, nurture their dreams, start with small manufacturing, and gradually expand. They went into internal and international trading, from smaller to larger ventures taking risk all the way. Vision, innovation, resilience, and more than anything an insatiable appetite for growing was all that sustained such entrepreneurs in our country. Acquiring land In a resource scarce land like ours, it has always been a tough journey. Land is so scarce, whereas one needs a big chunk for industrial outfits. One may find some waste land lying idle fringed by some habitation. The moment you step in, people notice and once you start to do something with it, the locals have already got the message. There will be middlemen, local influential people and politicians all will come running.  Groups will gather to send a message that anything you would like to do, it has to be through them. They will go out of their way to help, provided you walk their way and give each of them a slice of the prize.  Rivals will come, warning against the others and telling you to ignore the rest of the groups if you’d like a smooth purchase. They will present all the credentials to prove that they are the ones close to the party in power.  After a lengthy process on ground, in the land department and registration office, your luck may still run out when to your utter shock even more claimants arrive trying to prove their lineage as a grandchild of someone who had sold you a chunk. You will have to spend an additional sum to settle before you can finally go ahead.  Bureaucracy and infrastructure Then comes other important issues of getting power and gas supply which all are much more expensive than one finds on paper. A stubborn entrepreneur has to go ahead facing whatever comes his way. There are many who have to build a good length of road and other infrastructure at their own cost. If you are lucky, all will go smoothly when you face many other agencies such as the ministry of environment, the local government, ministry of industries, the river commission etc. The cost involved will always exceed your estimated budget. You have to spend money at every step even if everything goes well. The import of capital machinery, raw material, spares all are but big hassles. If you are in the business, you get used to it and employ a large outfit to get you going whenever you are stuck. Customs, NBR, and all agencies work as hurdles, not facilitators.  At the end of the day all expenditures, hidden or transparent, add up to your cost of business.  The cost involved will always exceed your estimated budget Need for protection The local law and order situation has a tremendous impact on doing business. Bringing in construction materials, giving contracts to firms for building your infrastructure, are all subject to be influenced by local hooligans who have allegiances to the political party in power. After you are already in the business, your industrial waste products are their next target which could be a business of sizable amount. You have no freedom of choice but to give in to the demand of the most powerful local group. It is unfortunate that though there are government agencies such as industrial police and riverine police, you happen to get no support whatsoever from them. There could be a report published that entrepreneur X is a river grabber. On the ground there may be a good number of industries on the same shoreline, but the allegation of grabbing is only against X. Many industrialists are having their own media houses which are used to downplay their rivals. Finding real visionaries There are entrepreneurs who don’t have assets abroad. All they have is investment in the country along with all their family members living here. Building an empire on foreign land has never been on their agenda.  Now is the time to encourage entrepreneurs who are genuinely working for the people and the country. It is for the sake of our survival, our lifeline, economy and business that we need to stand by them.  Now what could be some criteria to judge the genuineness of a conglomerate doing business in the country? Their total investment in the country, annual turnover, job creation, production range, declared investment abroad, assets abroad, contribution to the economy in terms of job creation, and export earnings could be some of the fields to categorize investors in the country. It is very easy for the media or any vested quarter to come up with allegations of wrong doings against a business firm, ruin its reputation and create an environment for the business to close down. But we must weigh the consequences, both long and short term.  Promoting entrepreneurship in Bangladesh is a matter of fighting impending job losses, scarcity of essentials, and the ultimate downturn of our economy before it becomes irreversible.  Brigadier General Qazi Abidus Samad, ndc, psc (Retd) is a freelance contributor.

He swerves into the wrong lane, determined to “beat the system.”  Minutes later, chaos erupts. Vehicles pile up in both directions, gridlocking the highway into a standstill worthy of a dystopian film.  This, dear readers, isn’t just bad driving -- it’s a masterclass in Bangladeshi governance. A few weeks ago, I wrote about a rogue motorbiker who turned a sidewalk into his personal racetrack, teaching me (almost) everything I needed to know about the state of our governance. Today, let’s zoom out from the sidewalk to the highway, where the same principles apply: Rules are optional, consequences are collective, and the system thrives on improvization.   The motorbiker’s legacy: From sidewalks to highways  Recall that motorbiker -- the one who treated pedestrians like bowling pins. His logic was simple: “Why suffer in traffic when you can create traffic?”  Fast-forward to the Dhaka-Chittagong Highway, and we see his spiritual successors: Drivers who’d rather invent new lanes than wait their turn. The result? A self-inflicted paradox where trying to avoid congestion causes congestion.  This isn’t just bad luck -- it’s a metaphor. In Bangladesh, governance often operates on the same “wrong-way shortcut” principle. Whether it’s political decisions, urban planning, or crisis management, the reflex is the same: Dodge the problem, even if it amplifies it.   The anatomy of a gridlock: A microcosm of systemic failure Let’s dissect the highway fiasco. What is the trigger? A traffic jam -- caused by poor infrastructure, unchecked growth, or monsoon floods. And so it invokes a reaction, where a driver thinks, “Why follow rules?” This causes a domino effect, where others mimic the rebellion, clogging both lanes.  What’s left in the aftermath? Hours lost, tempers flared, productivity evaporated. Replace “driver” with “policymaker” and “highway” with “economy,” and you’ve got a snapshot of governance. Consider:  - Power shortages met with quick-rental power plants (expensive, temporary, and environmentally disastrous).  - Illegal buildings “regularized” post-construction (rewarding chaos, punishing compliance).  - Political compromises that kick crises down the road (see: Traffic management, river encroachment, education reform). The pattern? Avoid the hard fix, embrace the easy bypass.    The cultural alibi: “But everyone else is doing it!”  In traffic and governance, accountability dissolves in a crowd. When one driver veers into the wrong lane, ten others follow, thinking, “If they’re breaking rules, why shouldn’t I?” Similarly, when one political leader or business tycoon flouts regulations, it sets a precedent: Rules are for suckers. This cultural alibi thrives on three pillars:  - Fatalism: “Traffic will always be bad, so why not cheat?” → “Corruption is inevitable, so why resist?”  - Individualism: “My time matters more than everyone else’s.” → “My gains outweigh collective losses.”  - Learned Helplessness: “The system won’t change, so adapt.” → “Why vote? Nothing changes anyway.”  The rogue motorbiker and the wrong-way driver are both products of this ecosystem. They’re not outliers -- they’re logical actors in a broken system.  In traffic and governance, accountability dissolves in a crowd The governance parallel: Policy in the wrong lane  Let’s map the highway debacle to governance failures:  - Traffic police absenteeism ⇌ Regulatory gaps: Where were the traffic cops as drivers U-turned into chaos? Likely shrugging, “What can we do?” -- a refrain echoed by regulators watching banks launder money or factories pollute rivers.  - The VIP lane mentality ⇌ Elite capture: When politicians’ and big business tycoons convoys muscle through traffic, they signal that some are above the law. Similarly, tax breaks for the powerful and impunity for influentials entrench a two-tiered system.  - Blame the victim ⇌ Gaslighting the public: After the highway mess, officials blamed drivers for “impatience.” Never mind the potholed roads or absent signage. Sound familiar? “Citizens don’t pay taxes!” (Never mind that services are dismal.)    Satirical solutions: How to govern like a wrong-way driver  If we’re committed to this ethos, let’s lean in. Here’s a policy playbook inspired by our highway heroes:  - The “creative infrastructure” plan: Why build bridges? Just let drivers invent new routes through rice fields. Similarly, why fix the economy? Print money and call it “innovation.”  - The “selective law enforcement” initiative: Traffic cops can ticket 10 drivers a day for show, while ignoring the other 10,000. Apply this to anti-corruption drives: Arrest a few small fry, let the sharks roam.  - The “blame the weather” doctrine: Monsoons flooded the highway? Perfect scapegoat. Likewise, blame global inflation for local mismanagement.  - The “citizen Darwinism” experiment: Let the public fight it out. Survival of the fittest on roads ⇌ No social safety nets.    Breaking the cycle: Can we U-turn out of this?  All satire aside, the highway gridlock -- like governance failures -- is a choice, not destiny. Fixing it requires: - Rule of law, not rule of chaos: Traffic cameras, fines, and consistent enforcement. Similarly, independent institutions to check power abuses.  - Planning beyond the next election: Invest in public transport, not quick-rental bandaids. Think metro rails, not flyovers to nowhere.  - Civic muscle memory: Celebrate those who wait in line, pay taxes, and report corruption. Make compliance aspirational.  - Leadership by example: If politicians’ convoys obey traffic rules, maybe citizens will too.    The road less travelled (correctly)  As I write this, another driver is probably veering into oncoming traffic somewhere, convinced he’s outsmarting the jam. But his “shortcut” will cost everyone hours -- a tragedy of the commons, Dhaka-style.  The rogue motorbiker on the sidewalk and the wrong-way driver on the highway are kindred spirits. They remind us that governance isn’t just about laws; it’s about culture, incentives, and the courage to endure short-term pain for long-term gain.  So the next time you’re stuck in traffic, take a breath. Don’t join the wrong-way rebels. Instead, think: This jam is our shared creation. Maybe getting out of it starts with staying in our lane.

Geography, in addition to social and economic hurdles, has made South Asia prone to the effects of climate change. The effects of extreme transformation of weather patterns around the globe is unimaginable. South Asia, having almost one-third of the global population, is one of the most affected areas by climate change. Natural disasters are most common in this region. Rapidly growing population and the depletion of existing natural resources amidst various climatic, social, political, and economic issues tend to create various security problems.  Weather change facilitates a range of challenges, including resource clashes, territorial disputes, and environmental catastrophes, among others which can lead to increased tension within already stressed nations. The changing weather patterns and the resultant socio-economic interferences would impact the environment, political stability, and economic welfare of Bangladesh such that it affects the whole region in a larger context.  The World Meteorological Organization has raised a critical alert regarding global warming, emphasizing concerning trends in environmental indicators. Bangladesh, Pakistan, and India have been identified as having some of the worst air quality levels globally, posing severe risks to public health and the environment.  Ann Harrison, a climate adviser for Amnesty International, expressed grave concern over the situation, stating that the prolonged exposure to hazardous air quality across large parts of South Asia represents a climate ""red alert."" She emphasized that this environmental crisis could lead to catastrophic consequences for the health and lives of more than a billion people in the region. The Children's Climate Risk Index report released by UNICEF reported that children living in Afghanistan, Bangladesh, India, and Pakistan are at very high risk of suffering the consequences of climate change. Alarmingly, 76% of children throughout the region face extreme heat and high levels of air pollution. The Asian Development Bank report paints a grim picture of climate change's escalating impact on South Asia, with the region already experiencing a warming trend of 0.75°C over the past century. This warming, combined with melting Himalayan glaciers and rising sea levels, directly threatens over 200 million people in Bangladesh, Bhutan, Maldives, Nepal, and Sri Lanka.  The economic consequences are equally alarming. Without global action to curb emissions, temperatures could soar by 4.6°C, causing GDP losses exceeding 8.8% by 2100 for the region. This economic downturn is linked to a projected surge in greenhouse gas emissions, with estimates showing a potential increase from 58 million tons of CO2 equivalent in 2005 to 245 million by 2030, driven primarily by growing energy demands in the industrial and transportation sectors.  76% of children throughout the region face extreme heat and high levels of air pollution Environmental impacts and security risks:  Climatic changes pose a very serious threat to the stability and security of the inhabitants of South Asia, particularly the ecosystem spanning from the Himalayas to the coastal plains of this region. Events like floods, droughts, and cyclones pose significant threats to human as well as environmental security.  Himalayan glaciers and coastal communities are all at risk of sea level rise that may cause mass migration and population pressure on the limited resources available, thus heightening the chances of conflict.  - Social and economic vulnerabilities: The economy of women and marginalized communities hugely dependent on agriculture and fisheries as their main source of income. Climate shocks like the collapse of crops, extreme reduction of water resources, and biodiversity depletion will further aggravate them to unwanted levels of famine, poverty, and violence in society.  - Economic implications and regional stability: The economies of South Asia are heavily dependent on climate-sensitive sectors, including agriculture, tourism, and hydropower. Lower agricultural output, damage to infrastructure, and ballooning disaster aid due to climate change will have a negative impact on national budget and stymie development. The upheaval of economies can also stoke social unrest and political instability, which can sap the integrity of states and lead to war both within and between countries.  - Political dimensions and transboundary challenges: Climate change certainly adds a layer of intricacy to an already complex South Asian political terrain. Climate change is likely to transform normally benign transboundary issues like sharing of water, migration, and disaster management into more contentious ones. Competition for basic core resources, especially water, might heighten tensions between riparian countries. Similarly, climate-induced migration and internal displacement may put stressors on relationships between nations, especially in cross-border movements.    Specific security challenges in South Asia - Water scarcity and conflict: The Himalayan glaciers also referred to as the ""Water Towers of Asia"" feed major rivers on which hundreds of millions of people in South Asia rely. Glacial melt and changing precipitation patterns threaten that supply, with potential conflict looming among the multiple nations involved in that water supply chain. The Indus Water Treaty between India and Pakistan is vaunted as one of the rare successes of transboundary water management, but these agreements will come under new stresses.  - Food security and social unrest: Most climate change projections for South Asia present significant threats to agricultural production, food security, and livelihood and potentially cause social unrest. Increased temperature, rainfall, and extreme weather fluctuations pose risks to agricultural production, potentially slashing yields and disrupting distribution channels. Food insecurity might mean more increases in prices, further magnified in periods of shortage; social unrest; or, in countries with too fragile a state, conflict itself.  - Climate-induced migration and displacement: Climate change is projected to displace millions of people within and across borders in South Asia due to rising sea levels, extreme weather events, and environmental degradation. Bangladesh is particularly vulnerable to climate-induced displacement because of its low-lying delta and dense population. Large-scale migration can overwhelm resources, increase social tensions, and pose security risks to countries of origin and destination alike.   - Increased disaster risks and humanitarian crises: South Asia is naturally susceptible to many kinds of disasters, from floods and cyclones to droughts. The climate is changing, and these events are happening more often and with more force. This is very dangerous for people's safety, and disaster response teams are already overworked. The 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami and the 2010 floods in Pakistan acted as strong reminders of the devastation caused by climate-related disasters within the region.  - Vulnerable action of non-state actors: The fact that climate change is linked to regional security in South Asia shows how non-state actors can play a part. Jihadist groups are one example of these groups that can use climate-related weaknesses to further their own goals. Economic hardships, loss of livelihoods, and displacement provide a fertile recruiting ground for radicalization, promising some sort of solutions or support. In Bangladesh, where poverty and other problems already threaten political and social stability, climate change may further deteriorate these conditions, opening more opportunities for extremist groups to gain influence and undermine government authority may destabilize the entire South Asian region. Therefore, coordination is crucial in confronting these risks.  Discussions on mechanisms for climate adaptation and mitigation between South Asian countries may permanently change the tone, tenor, and content of international relations in South Asia Addressing the challenges The above challenges can only be approached through the lines of mitigation, adaptation, and regional cooperation.  - Mitigation: An acute need for mitigation of GHG emissions is required to keep the magnitude of climate change impacts at their lowest. South Asian countries urgently need to transition to clean energy and energy efficiency, as well as adopt sustainable land-use practices that require international cooperation and financing.  - Adaptation: There is a need to invest in human security for building resilience to the impact of climate change through the construction of climate-resilient infrastructure, putting in place early warning systems, and doing sustainable agriculture and water management. In addition, all community-based adaptation strategies are highly valued in enabling local communities to cope with climate change.  - Regional cooperation: Addressing transboundary challenges requires enhanced regional cooperation. South Asian countries need to strengthen existing mechanisms for water sharing, disaster management, and climate information sharing in ensuring the protection of vulnerable populations.  - Sustainable agriculture: Promoting climate-smart agriculture practices can help farmers cope with changing climatic conditions and ensure food security.  - A region-wide energy grid builds interdependence: A region-wide renewable energy grid will form an important factor in the framework of the South Asia set-up. Because of complementarity, the regional characteristics of demand and supply are highly suitable for this area. Each of them—hydropower, solar, and wind opens enormous possibilities to South Asia in different respects. There is an actual economic, ecological, and energetic miracle attached to the idea of keeping thousands of miles of states bound on the grid where participation and sharing exist.    In conclusion, the most critical security threat for the South Asia region, climate change, mainly manifests due to a series of wide impacts on natural ecology, social spheres, the economy, and politics. Regardless of the specific issue, the discussions on mechanisms for climate adaptation and mitigation between South Asian countries may permanently change the tone, tenor, and content of international relations in South Asia. It could also make it much easier for the whole region to limit the damage caused by the climate crisis. Lieutenant Colonel SM Rezaur Rahman, psc, Signals, Bangladesh Army.",NA

Over the years, it has been rightfully criticized, and there have long been calls for it to take more people-centric decisions. To that end, we are encouraged to see the forward-thinking consideration by the NBR to potentially raise the tax-free income ceiling in the upcoming national budget. According to reports, the NBR is contemplating an increase of up to Tk 50,000 for the fiscal year 2025-26.  With everyday Bangladeshis currently facing the pressures of inflation and the rising cost of living, this move is certainly the correct one. By raising the tax-free income ceiling, it is good to see the NBR finally recognizing the urgent need to ease the financial burden on low- and middle-income earners, who spend a significant portion of their income on daily essentials.  It is people-centric policies such as these that are vital for fostering not only economic stability but also improving the quality of life for many citizens. While revenue collection is vital, and the NBR continues to fail to have the right approaches to ensure we do better in this regard, the necessity of aligning tax policy with the realities of household expenses can simply no longer be ignored. We hope that this step is just the first in a series of steps taken by the NBR -- one that prioritizes transparency, fairness, and empathy over bureaucratic rigidity and harassment.  Tax collection in Bangladesh is defined by complex procedures and undue pressure on honest citizens. We hope that the NBR can finally bring the necessary shift toward a more just and accountable taxation system. A tax system should serve the people, not intimidate them.",NA

However, while its importance can certainly not be questioned, for the overall development of the nation, the answer lies not just in attracting foreign capital but also in empowering local investment.  To that end, it is encouraging to see that a new generation of local investors are fast emerging as game changers of the nation’s economic landscape. Over the past six years, local investment in Bangladesh has soared by 137.5%, rising from Tk80 billion in 2018 to Tk190bn in 2024.  This achievement tells us that our domestic investors are increasingly taking the lead across a diverse range of sectors, from technology and textiles to fintech and retail.  Of course, local investors go beyond capital and simultaneously offer a nuanced understanding of our unique social, cultural, and economic dynamics, enabling faster, more informed decisions that foreign backers often cannot match.  Arguably their biggest impact has been in their support for smaller start-ups and SMEs, enterprises which frequently struggle to attract international funding due to scale or perceived risk.  It has been said time and time again how we cannot lose our smaller enterprises, and their empowerment is crucial to not just keeping profits and talent within the country, but also fuel job creation, innovation, and eventually inclusive growth, especially for women and youth. Our future prosperity depends on our ability to continue encouraging and nurturing our local investors -- not as mere financiers, but as leaders of our new economy.",NA

A recent report of Indian newspaper The Hindu published on the World Press Freedom Day claiming the Prof Yunus-led Bangladesh government has targeted 640 journalists in eight months is fake, it said in a Facebook post on its verified account - CA Press Wing Facts. ""Allegations by the Rights and Risks Analysis Group (RRAG) published in The Hindu, that Bangladesh's Interim Government has targeted 640 journalists, are a wildly misleading piece of disinformation,"" it said. Since the Bangladeshis overthrew the brutal and corrupt regime of Sheikh Hasina's Awami League, many journalists perceived to have been linked to the regime have come under pressure from various quarters. Many have faced legal charges made possible by the flaws in the justice system deliberately created by the Awami League and now being corrected under the interim government, according to the statement. ""It is entirely untrue that the interim government itself has targeted journalists. On the contrary, the chief adviser, a Nobel Peace Laureate and his press secretary, formerly an AFP bureau chief in Dhaka, among many others in the interim government, have been recognised for decades as champions of press freedom,"" it said. The press wing claimed that the RRAG, led by Suhas Chakma, on the contrary, is known to support the Awami League and has frequently spread disinformation about Bangladesh since Hasina's overthrow by the people of Bangladesh on August 5 last. RRAG played a central role in spreading inflated claims about the September 2024 violence in Bangladesh's Chittagong Hill Tracts. While credible Bangladeshi media confirmed four deaths in three incidents across Khagrachari and Rangamati, RRAG claimed nine indigenous people were killed - a figure unsupported by independent investigations. ""Suhas Chakma reiterated this claim in a News9 interview and pushed for diplomatic action, stating that Indian Chakma leaders urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to reassess ties with Bangladesh,"" the statement noted. The Human Rights Congress for Bangladeshi Minorities (HRCBM) later amplified the number of people killed to 67, based on RRAG's assertions-claims debunked by DismisLab's investigative report ""From Four to a Hundred"". Pro-Awami League Journalist Tasmiah Ahmed cited them in her Deutsche Welle article criticising human rights under Professor Muhammad Yunus, just months after labelling student protestors as ""terrorists"". In March 2025, RRAG appealed to the UN, accusing Prof Yunus of downplaying religiously motivated violence. Simultaneously, the group launched attacks on fact-checkers, undermining those who challenged its narratives. ""The interim government deplores persecution of members of any group and is working, along with countless Bangladeshi citizens, to undo the legacy of the Awami League and to make Bangladesh a country in which all citizens can live and work in conditions of security and dignity,"" the statement read.",NA

https://www.dhakatribune.com///www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/health/380467/what-are-the-key-proposals-of-the-health-reform,What are the key proposals of the Health Reform Commission?,https://www.dhakatribune.com///www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/health/380467/what-are-the-key-proposals-of-the-health-reform,"At the heart of the report is a demand that primary healthcare be constitutionally declared a fundamental right and provided free of charge to all citizens The interim government's Health Reform Commission has submitted a sweeping set of recommendations that could fundamentally change the way healthcare is delivered in Bangladesh. At the heart of the report is a demand that primary healthcare be constitutionally declared a fundamental right and provided free of charge to all citizens. The report was formally handed over to Chief Adviser Dr Muhammad Yunus on Monday at the state guesthouse Jamuna. The chief adviser, in a Facebook post later that day, confirmed that immediate directives have already been issued to implement those recommendations that are ready for execution. This commission was one of several established following the dramatic fall of the Awami League government in last year’s mass uprising, led by students and ordinary citizens. National Professor Dr AK Azad Khan chaired the twelve-member team, which worked for over five months to produce the most comprehensive health sector reform proposal in recent memory. The commission’s membership included prominent academics, clinicians, administrators and even a student representative—an important gesture toward democratic inclusiveness. They call for an amendment to the Constitution to declare primary healthcare a fundamental right, superseding the current Article 18 which frames public health as a mere duty of the state. The proposed Primary Healthcare Ordinance would make this right legally enforceable, guaranteeing all citizens access to essential services regardless of income or location. The commission insists that these services be provided free of charge, and that existing health laws be updated to reflect the demands of a rapidly evolving population and disease landscape. To address the governance vacuum that has long plagued the sector, the report proposes the establishment of an independent National Health Commission, which would provide policy oversight and support to both Parliament and the executive. In addition, a new administrative body under the Ministry of Health, the Bangladesh Health Service, would be created to consolidate expertise from both the public and private sectors. The report is equally unambiguous in its call to scrap the current BCS Health Cadre system, recommending instead the creation of a Health Public Service Commission for recruitment and career management. On the matter of healthcare financing, the commission urges the government to enact a law mandating that at least 5% of GDP be allocated to the health sector. It also calls for tax exemptions on medicines for non-communicable diseases like cancer and diabetes and pushes for the development of specialised services—such as oncology, organ transplant, and high-risk surgery—to stem the tide of medical tourism and bring equity to advanced care. But the commission does not stop at systems and structures. The report recommends full enforcement of the Government Servants Conduct Rules of 1979 to restrict political activities among health officials and calls for a ban on appointing party-affiliated individuals as executive heads of health institutions. As part of the commission’s work, a nationwide opinion survey conducted by the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics gathered responses from 8,256 adult citizens across all eight divisions. An overwhelming 97% of respondents called for price regulation on medicines, while 96% demanded standardisation of consultation fees. Fixed pricing for diagnostic tests and surgical procedures received support from 16% and 15% of respondents, respectively. Seventeen percent believed primary healthcare should be completely free—a figure that speaks volumes in a country where out-of-pocket expenditure remains among the highest in the world. An extraordinary 92% supported establishing rural-style primary care centres in urban areas, reinforcing the need for spatial equity in health infrastructure. However, 72% of those surveyed advocated for the separation of clinical treatment, public health education, and disease prevention into distinct administrative branches. Meanwhile, 76% supported allowing the transfer of support staff, while 68% were opposed to antibiotics being sold without prescriptions from MBBS-qualified doctors. A full 79% backed high taxation on unhealthy foods, beverages, and consumer goods. The appetite for health insurance is also strong, with 71% expressing interest in enrolling if systems were in place. In a clear call for greater efficiency, 67% of respondents supported merging similar services currently run by the Directorate General of Health Services and the Directorate General of Family Planning. Receiving the report, Dr Muhammad Yunus called it a “watershed moment” and warned that further delay would be inexcusable. “The problems in our health sector have been with us for a long time. If we can resolve these through the reforms, it will be a historic breakthrough,” he said. Stressing that implementation must begin immediately, Yunus pointed to one of the sector’s most entrenched problems—the chronic shortage and misallocation of doctors. “Even where we have doctors, they’re not posted where needed. This must be solved permanently,” he said. He added: “We cannot fix this without decentralisation. We must ensure that doctors remain in their assigned posts.”",NA

Witnesses reported that the crowd, waving party and national flags, includes members not only from Dhaka but also from Gazipur. Altaf Hossain, a Jubo Dal activist from Gazipur, told Bangla Tribune that he came out of love for his party. “Many more activists are on their way from my hometown,” he said. He added, “Madam’s return to the country is a historic event. Who would not want to witness history? Besides, the party has directed us to be here. That’s why I came.” Abu Bakar, a BNP activist from the Kawla area, said: “People are eagerly waiting to vote for BNP after the fall of the fascists. Madam is returning today. You’ll see—an election date will be announced soon.” BNP Chairperson Khaleda Zia is scheduled to arrive at Shahjalal International Airport at 10:30am on Tuesday. BNP Secretary General Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir, along with senior party leaders, will receive Khaleda at Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport upon her arrival. Though a Qatari royal ambulance carrying Khaleda, her two daughters-in-law, and other entourage members is scheduled to land at the airport at 10:30 am, BNP supporters began gathering on the footpaths along both sides of the nearly 10-kilometre road on the route from early morning, holding national and party flags to greet Khaleda on her homecoming. The special air ambulance, provided by Qatar’s Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, carrying BNP Chairperson Khaleda Zia and her entourage, took off from Heathrow Airport around 9:35pm (BST) on Monday. As the BNP chief will be travelling from Dhaka Airport to her residence in Gulshan via Kakoli, the party has designated specific locations for its affiliated bodies and leaders to take positions along the route in a disciplined manner to avoid causing traffic jams. To avoid congestion, DMP urged commuters to use alternative routes during the morning and midday hours. Suggested routes include:",NA

""We need to understand our responsibilities and shape our actions accordingly,"" he said while addressing a session on “Food Markets, Supply, and Local Capacity” during the “Agriculture, Food Security and Living Nature Conference 2025” organized by the Bonik Barta in the capital. Speaking as chief guest, the adviser stressed the importance of a collaborative approach involving the country's brightest minds to formulate an effective food policy. ""If we don't ensure food security, we could face dire consequences,"" he warned, adding, ""There must be significant investment in this area."" ""If the food market is valued at Tk30,000 crore, we must clearly identify the corresponding investments and ensure that appropriate funding follows,"" he noted. He put emphasis on ensuring fair trade, stabilization of market and creating buffer zone in order to supplement the government efforts towards ensuring food security as well as smooth trade and commerce operations in the country. The adviser also pointed out that agriculture is not limited to food production alone-it also includes other sectors like floriculture and animal feed. He proposed developing an inflation index based on 17 essential commodities to effectively monitor and regulate the market. Highlighting the critical role of data, he said the lack of accurate and reliable statistics remains a major barrier to informed decision-making. He cited last year's potato production figures as an example, noting that despite official claims of over 10 million tonnes of production, prices surged over Tk90 per kilogram. ""Many figures fail to align because the available statistics are flawed,"" he said, stressing the need to fix the country's data systems. He said hoarding must be justified by public or private sector to stop price manipulation of essentials, mentioning egg hoarding and artificial price escalation before recent Ramadan. Reflecting on the fiscal practices of the previous administration under the Awami League, he added, ""Spending was celebrated as an achievement. The qualification standard was based on how much one could spend."" Chairman and Managing Director of Meghna Group of Industries Mostafa Kamal said the government should develop large-scale storage capacity to ensure food security during times of need. Managing Director of Kazi Farms Kazi Zahedul Hasan urged the commerce adviser not to fix prices of poultry prices, but rather to allow the market to operate on the basis of competition. He also alleged that poultry businessmen are facing harassment. Director of Group Corporate and Legal Affairs of Quality Feeds Safir Rahman emphasized the importance of ensuring not only food security but also nutrition security for building a healthy nation. Managing Director of ACI Logistics Ltd (Shwapno) Sabbir Hasan Nasir said consumer confidence index has been improving in recent months, a optimistic sign for commodity market and inflation. Chief Operating Officer of Square Food & Beverage Ltd. Parvez Saiful Islam urged the government to build storage capacity for small traders.

From sleek 4K smart TVs to budget-friendly Android models, the choices today are broader than ever. As Bangladeshi households upgrade from basic LED units to smart TVs with integrated streaming platforms, understanding which brands offer the best value, features, and reliability has never been more important. In 2025, several key brands are shaping the consumer TV experience across different price segments. Samsung continues to dominate the premium segment in Bangladesh. Known for its cutting-edge display technology, Samsung’s QLED and Crystal UHD TVs deliver stunning picture quality, sharp contrasts, and rich colors. The company’s proprietary Tizen operating system offers a fluid smart TV interface, with seamless access to popular apps like Netflix, YouTube, and Amazon Prime. Samsung televisions are also known for their longevity and are supported by an extensive after-sales network across Bangladesh. While the price tag may be on the higher end, many consumers see it as a long-term investment in quality and performance. Samsung TVs are widely available through major retailers, including Star Tech, where official models with warranty coverage are frequently stocked. LG, another South Korean electronics giant, is equally prominent in the Bangladeshi market. The brand has earned a reputation for its OLED TVs, which offer deep blacks, precise color calibration, and immersive viewing angles—ideal for movie lovers and gaming enthusiasts alike. LG’s WebOS is one of the most user-friendly smart TV interfaces, offering fast performance and intelligent features through LG ThinQ AI. In both design and durability, LG TV continues to impress, especially in the mid-to-high-end categories. With local availability and solid warranty support, LG remains a go-to choice for consumers looking for innovation and reliability. Sony maintains its position as one of the most respected TV brands worldwide, and in Bangladesh, it appeals strongly to those prioritizing premium image and sound quality. Sony’s Bravia series, now powered by Google TV, provides a refined experience that combines brilliant 4K visuals with cinematic audio output. Sony TVs excel in motion handling, making them a favorite among sports fans and film enthusiasts. Though generally more expensive than competitors, Sony products are synonymous with excellence and tend to perform consistently well for years. For buyers willing to invest in high-end performance, Sony is a name that continues to deliver. For added assurance, purchasing from trusted sources like Star Tech helps ensure you’re getting original Sony TVs with official warranty support. Chinese brand Hisense is making steady inroads into the Bangladeshi market by offering high-spec TVs at competitive prices. Known for producing budget and mid-range smart TVs with features like Dolby Vision, HDR10+, and built-in Chromecast, Hisense has become a popular alternative for those seeking quality without a premium price. The brand’s adoption of Google TV across many of its new models adds to its appeal, allowing users to access a wide array of apps and streaming platforms. Hisense televisions are increasingly available in major electronics stores and online platforms in Bangladesh. Star Tech, among others, regularly features Hisense TV models for buyers seeking reliable, feature-rich televisions on a tighter budget. Haier, traditionally known for home appliances, has been expanding its TV lineup in Bangladesh with a focus on affordability and smart functionality. Haier TVs are generally targeted at mid-range buyers who want modern features like Android TV OS, voice control, and HDMI-ARC support without the steep costs associated with top-tier brands. While not as technologically advanced as Samsung or LG, Haier TVs are known for their decent picture quality and stable performance. Their growing presence in both physical retail and e-commerce makes them an accessible choice for many households upgrading to smart TVs for the first time. Xiaomi, the tech disruptor from China, continues to shake up the smart TV market in Bangladesh. Best known for offering smart features at aggressive prices, Xiaomi TVs run on Android TV and feature Xiaomi’s PatchWall interface, which integrates content from various streaming platforms into a unified dashboard. The brand’s popularity among younger buyers stems from its sleek design, reliable 4K resolution panels, and frequent software updates. Xiaomi’s offerings are particularly strong in the 32-inch to 55-inch category, making them ideal for small apartments and medium-sized living rooms. Star Tech is one of the leading retailers where Xiaomi smart TVs are available with competitive pricing and after-sales support. Singer, one of the most recognizable names in Bangladesh’s consumer electronics landscape, has also expanded its smart TV range in recent years. While once known primarily for basic LED televisions, Singer now offers smart TVs that feature Android operating systems, HD and FHD resolutions, and slim designs. With a strong local presence and competitive pricing, Singer TV is often considered a reliable option for budget-conscious consumers. The brand also benefits from an extensive service network throughout the country, giving it an edge when it comes to after-sales support and warranty fulfillment. In 2025, the television market in Bangladesh is more vibrant than ever. Consumers now prioritize smart functionality, display quality, and brand reliability just as much as they consider price. Samsung, LG, and Sony continue to lead the high-end and premium segments with technological innovation and strong brand trust. At the same time, brands like Xiaomi, Hisense, Haier, and Singer offer attractive alternatives that meet the needs of budget-conscious buyers without compromising too much on modern features.

He is set to launch ""What"" (www.what.net.in), an innovative online shopping platform with a unique social mission. A particular portion of the profits from this business will be directly allocated to developing an AI-based SOS Alert Mechanism aimed at preventing teenage rape across Bangladesh. Sadat’s vision is not just to build a successful business, but to create meaningful social impact through entrepreneurship. By leveraging the power of AI technology, he hopes to provide faster and smarter emergency responses for teenagers in danger, addressing a critical gap in child protection mechanisms. This initiative reflects Sadat's continued commitment to using modern technology as a tool for social good. The establishment of ""What"" has been further strengthened with the support and guidance of Ejazur Rahman Sajal, assistant professor of Business Administration at Daffodil International University. His mentorship has been instrumental in shaping Sadat’s approach to combining business innovation with social responsibility. This new venture marks another milestone in Sadat's already remarkable journey as a child and human rights activist. Born on March 22, 2009, Shahi Al Sadat founded The Startup IO in 2021 before even turning 13. Under his leadership, the organization has introduced several pioneering initiatives including Kids Helplink, Startup Cyber, the Anti-Harassment Committee, GirlsTeenSafe, and the internationally recognized Teen-X mobile application, which combats human trafficking and teenage sexual violence. Through his leadership, The Startup IO has successfully handled over 300 cases related to child marriage and violations of child rights. His help management system has contributed to the arrest of nine perpetrators over the last two years. Operating across seven districts in Bangladesh—Meherpur, Sylhet, Munshiganj, Rangpur, Dinajpur, Nilphamari, and Moulvibazar—the organization has reached more than 100,000 teenagers through online and offline awareness campaigns. Sadat’s exceptional work has earned him both national and international accolades. In 2024, he was nominated for the prestigious International Children’s Peace Prize and received the National Tech Award for his impactful contributions to digital safety and child rights advocacy. He has also been invited as a speaker at TEDx 2025 at Daffodil International University, where his message will be shared with an audience exceeding 45 million people worldwide. Furthermore, his dedication has been recognized academically with a fully funded scholarship from Rice University in Texas, US, for the Women, Gender & Sexuality Studies program, beginning in Fall 2027. Despite these extraordinary achievements, Sadat remains a humble student, currently preparing for his SSC 2025 examinations. He attributes his success to the unwavering support of his father, Md Shafikul Islam, whose encouragement he cites as the foundation of every milestone he has reached. Sadat also holds deep admiration for his closest friend, Maisha Maliha, acknowledging her as a constant source of support throughout his journey. ""When everyone else turned away, Maliha stood beside me. I will always be grateful to her. I hope our friendship remains unshaken for a lifetime,"" Sadat shared emotionally. In addition to the upcoming launch of ""What,"" Sadat’s organization, The Startup IO, is preparing to introduce another groundbreaking project—the FreeMind App, an AI-powered mental health platform designed to reduce mental health disorders among students. The app is expected to launch on the Google Play Store on August 12, 2025. With unwavering determination, Sadat stated: ""I am determined to raise Bangladesh’s name and flag on the global stage. My mission is to eliminate child trafficking and teenage rape from this nation."" Through ""What"" and his continuing activism, Shahi Al Sadat is not only bringing pride to Bangladesh but also inspiring a global generation of young changemakers.",NA
https://www.dhakatribune.com///www.dhakatribune.com/feature/travel/379162/a-ride-on-the-dark-night-express,A ride on the Dark Night Express,https://www.dhakatribune.com///www.dhakatribune.com/feature/travel/379162/a-ride-on-the-dark-night-express,"Jamuna Fertiliser Company helped put Tarakandi on the map, but the area’s rail tracks tell stories dating back to colonial times “Let us have tea,” he told me, and walked into a tea stall without giving me the chance to say no. Barely five minutes had passed since I met him. To say he met me would be more appropriate, as he struck up a conversation when I was wandering on the platform and observing the vicinity. I do not drink tea but still followed him into the shop as he said he works for the railway. jwARI.fetch( $( ""#ari-image-jw6819ca9ccf7b7"" ) ); Such a person, I thought, could give me clues that would help me find the answer to my question. For nearly a month, I had been contemplating who boards an intercity train that starts from a small, rural railway station at 2am. I had naively assumed no such train in Bangladesh begins its journey between midnight and 6am, until I came to know about Jamuna Express. This train runs every day between Dhaka and the Tarakandi station in Jamalpur, a north-central district on the bank of the Jamuna River. By the time I arrived at the station, it was already past midnight. Adjusting the balaclava to keep only my eyes bare, I prepared for a long wait on a cold December night. “I guess a variety of passengers take this train at this hour – job holders, traders, and those having day-to-day affairs in various districts of the Mymensingh division,” the bearded railway worker replied when I enquired about the Jamuna Express passengers’ characteristics. Sipping tea from the cup and puffing on a cigarette, he further said there might also be passengers who would catch a bus or another train from Dhaka in the morning to travel elsewhere, thus needing to board this train in the middle of the night. At this stage, he gave me his name – Sujan. I covered my cup with both hands so as not to let him see that it was still almost full while his one was about to be empty. jwARI.fetch( $( ""#ari-image-jw6819ca9ccf7e9"" ) ); The shop owner, with one of his hands amputated, was adeptly making tea for other customers sitting on plastic chairs scattered outside. The way he talked to Sujan indicated they already knew each other. Some folks were watching the news on the TV placed on a plank in a corner. “If you want to ride this train, you have to leave for the Tarakandi station probably at or after midnight, depending on where you live. International flight departures between midnight and 6am are common, but this is the only Bangladeshi intercity train that starts rolling in total darkness. It is the day’s first train,” Sujan kept on explaining to satisfy my curiosity. “So, we can call it the Dark Night Express?” I suggested. He slightly nodded but maintained nonchalance in his face, as if it did not matter if the Dark Night Express was a misnomer. Our conversation ended abruptly when one of his co-workers requested his presence on the platform. My hands felt the cool winter breeze as I watched the short range of activities at the station. A female artist was rendering a folk song on TV at the tea stall right next to the station building, drawing a small crowd. Boys in groups walked back and forth on the platform, chatting, laughing, and occasionally talking loudly. In the station master's room were several people talking to the official who sat at the computer desk. Around the corner was the ticket counter where two to three men stood, leaving me wondering whether they would buy physical tickets. Outside the counter, on the dirty floor, slept two persons, their bodies enveloped in blankets and the air filled with the stench of urine from the adjacent toilet. Lights of various intensities coming from different directions blended into the mist and turned the station into an artwork of chiaroscuro. Behind the station appeared banana and other trees as well as a few tin-roofed houses, with faint lights coming through some of the windows. The locomotive’s roar, which cut through the silence of the night, could be heard from yards away. Set up in 1991, Jamuna Fertiliser Company has helped put Tarakandi on the map, but the area’s rail tracks tell stories dating back to colonial times. The red-brick station building, typical of the British era, was built during the Mymensingh-Jagannathganj line’s construction in 1898–99. The now defunct Jagannathganj Ghat station on the Jamuna bank had ferry services between the eastern and western districts of present-day Bangladesh. Jute grew galore in the alluvial land of flood-prone Jamalpur, which was named after Shah Jamal who came from Yemen to preach Islam during the reign of Mughal emperor Akbar. Rail lines were built to facilitate the cash crop’s transportation to Dhaka and the inland port of Narayanganj, from where it was shipped to Kolkata. Jamalpur’s Sarishabari upazila, where the Tarakandi station is located, was a flourishing jute trade hub, earning as much prominence as Narayanganj, known as the Dundee of Bangladesh. That glory is now lost because of the closure of jute mills one after another, rendering thousands of workers unemployed and forcing many to change professions. Not far from the Sarishabari station are Alhaj Jute Mills and ARA Jute Mills, both closed over the last decade. But mustard, another major crop of Sarishabari, still retains its glory, with many people visiting the huge swathes of yellow mustard fields in winter to soak in the mesmerising beauty. “There are three Dhaka-bound trains from Tarakandi every day. Jamalpur Express and Aghnibina Express leave in the afternoon/evening and reach Dhaka at 10:40pm at the earliest. If you want to be in Dhaka in the daytime, Jamuna Express is your only option,” explained the man sitting next to me when I asked him why he had taken the train, which left Tarakandi two minutes late. “But passengers can take the bus early in the morning and avoid the night journey. They can have a good night’s sleep at home and set off for Dhaka in the morning in a fresh mood. Plus, the bus reaches Dhaka faster than the train,” I disputed. “Yes, but there could be traffic jams and other uncertainties on the road. Besides, many do not prefer the bus ride. Additionally, there are passengers who do not think like you when it comes to a good night’s sleep. You can travel in first class if you need more comfort and better sleep,” he refuted. I could not contradict him more. Our Shovon Chair carriage, which had 17 passengers when we left Tarakandi, was not designed for ultimate comfort. The maroon seats were not padded and there was not enough legroom, while my reclining lever did not work. The train’s vacuum-brake coaches are very old but heavy-duty, I remembered Sujan saying. He did not remember any bizarre or memorable incident happening on board on the Dhaka–Tarakandi route, which he had been serving continuously for a year. He seemed to have a liking for the classic blue-yellow carriages that were in fashion when millennials like me were growing up. Many travellers curled up on their seats, trying to get some sleep as the clank of wheels on tracks filled the compartment. I walked to the door and leaned out, looking at the nightscape featuring outlines of paddy fields, the sway of nearby tree leaves and branches in the strong wind produced by the speeding train, and occasional rural homes in the distance. A teen boy standing nearby said he had boarded the train because he needed to travel to Dhaka at night. The Tarakandi–Mymensingh route looks almost like a semicircle, with the Jamalpur–Mymensingh stretch running along the old Brahmaputra channel. The stations came alive when the train screeched to a halt as passengers, attired in elaborate warm clothes, scrambled to find the doors of their respective compartments. Under the inky black sky, the Jamalpur station, where we reached at around 3:15am, was engulfed in thick fog, which diffused the overhead and outdoor lights, creating a spotlight effect. I very much wanted to enjoy the foggy landscape bathed in the golden hues of the early morning light – a scene you can witness only during the short-lived winter – but missed it. Waking up to the chit-chat of passengers, I noticed on the map that we had crossed the Mymensingh division and were on our way to Joydebpur. Hawkers squeezed through the aisle of the packed carriage to sell tea and snacks. Around two hours later at the Kamalapur station, it was a typical day with a flurry of activity – a stark contrast to where I was seven hours ago. I strode to the locomotive and scanned the adjacent carriage, hoping to see a familiar face. But Sujan was nowhere in sight, gone like the dark night.",NA

For many years, Rajmoni Circus has traveled throughout Bangladesh, continuing to captivate audiences with its thrilling performances. At Rajmoni Circus, spectators can experience a variety of exciting performances. One of the most popular acts includes the daredevil performers who leap from great heights, executing acrobatic feats that seem impossible. There's also the mesmerizing sight of snake charmers, who bring live snakes into the arena, showcasing their delicate and seemingly dangerous skills. And of course, no circus is complete without the comedic relief of clowns, who don exaggerated costumes and perform humorous skits, spreading joy to the crowd.

Away from the game since agreeing a suspension with the World Anti-Doping Agency in February, Sinner was welcomed back to action Monday by thousands of fans who watched his first training session at the tournament on centre court at Foro Italico. Such is the interest in Sinner, who has become a national hero in Italy since rising to the top of the men's game, that Sky Sport broadcast the practice match with world No 38 Jiri Lehecka live on television. All eyes will be on the 23-year old as he has not swung a racket since retaining his Australian Open title in January, a victory which took his Grand Slam tally to three. ""I'm very happy, happy to be back here. It has been a very long, long three months,"" Sinner told reporters in a packed conference room inside the centre court. Fans in Rome have waited two years to see Sinner play their clay court tournament after he missed last year's edition, won by Alexander Zverev, with injury. It is on a surface which is not his favourite and his rustiness was clear to see Monday. Only one of Sinner's 19 titles has come on clay, in Umag back in 2022, the same year as his best result in Rome, a quarter-final exit at the hands of beaten finalist Stefanos Tsitsipas. However he does have some time before he finally takes to the court, his status as the top-ranked player on the men's tour allowing him a bye into the second round which starts Friday. Sinner has been fortunate that none of his rivals took advantage of his enforced pause, with second-ranked Zverev still almost 2,000 points behind the man who beat him in the Australian Open final. Meanwhile Carlos Alcaraz is yet to arrive in Rome after withdrawing from the Madrid Open while Novak Djokovic will have to wait a bit longer for his 100th Association of Tennis Professionals title after deciding to sit out a tournament he has won six times. Sinner is eyeing a run at the French Open, the second Slam of the season which follows the Rome tournament. ""My objective is Roland Garros, I'm here to see what level I'm at,"" said Sinner. ""I'm not here to beat whoever, but to get past the second round and then see what happens."" Sinner's rise to the top of the game in 2024, when he won eight titles including his first two Slams and the ATP Finals, was dogged by the controversy which followed his two positive tests for traces of clostebol in March last year. He said last month he hit ""rock bottom"" at the most recent Australian Open, saying he felt like other players ""looked at me differently"". Sinner was aggrieved as he feels he did nothing wrong, and WADA said explicitly he ""did not intend to cheat"", accepting he was contaminated by his physiotherapist using a spray containing the banned substance to treat a cut before providing a massage. Regardless, he also had to accept the three-month ban offered by WADA, rather than risk being forced out of tennis for two years just as he became the dominant force in men's tennis. ""I didn't want to do it in the beginning. It was a bit not easy for me to accept it because I know what really happened,"" said Sinner. ""But sometimes you have to choose the best in a very bad moment. And that's what we did. It's all over now, so I'm happy to play again.""",NA

PSG host Arsenal at Parc des Princes Wednesday in the second leg of their semi-final and come into the match with a 1-0 lead following last week's clash in London. Dembele scored the only goal at Emirates Stadium, his 33rd of the season in all competitions further underlining his status as the leader of the Paris attack in the wake of Kylian Mbappe's departure. But Donnarumma played a key part too with five saves, including two of the highest class to deny Gabriel Martinelli and Leandro Trossard. The Italian was also posted missing when Arsenal scored early in the second half, coming off his line at a free-kick and getting nowhere near the ball, only to be rescued by an offside decision. But Donnarumma's shot-stopping allowed Luis Enrique's side to thwart the Gunners and followed decisive contributions against Liverpool and Aston Villa in each of the two previous rounds. ""To be champions you need a great goalkeeper,"" said PSG captain Marquinhos after Donnarumma's array of saves prevented them from caving in completely to a Villa fightback in the second leg of their quarter-final. PSG won the first leg 3-1 at home and were two goals ahead at half-time in the return, only for Villa to score three times and threaten to level the tie. Donnarumma came to the rescue with superb interventions to keep out a Marcus Rashford shot and a Youri Tielemans header in particular. ""We are aware of the goalkeeper we have, he's one of the best. Lots of people have doubts about him, but not us,"" said Achraf Hakimi after that game. ""We know he is one of the best goalkeepers in the world. We are pleased to have him at PSG and we hope he stays for as long as possible."" The Italian had already been the hero in the penalty shoot-out win away to Liverpool in the last 16, saving from Darwin Nunez and Curtis Jones. There is a sense in Paris of the 26-year old, who stands 1.96m tall, finally imposing himself at the club he joined in 2021. Donnarumma had just starred for Italy in their European Championship triumph, performing heroics as they beat England at Wembley to win the trophy. But he was forced to share the gloves with Keylor Navas in his first season, in which he was notably guilty of a costly error in a Champions League collapse against Real Madrid. Donnarumma did go on to establish himself as PSG's first-choice goalkeeper, but he has not always convinced. There has been plenty of speculation that the club might look to replace the goalkeeper whose contract expires at the end of next season. PSG have even been linked with Lille's Lucas Chevalier, an outstanding prospect at the age of just 23 who has already broken into the full France squad. Donnarumma's quality as a shot-stopper has never really been called into question, but his ability to play out with the ball at his feet has. That is an issue given the way coach Enrique likes his team to play, and the Spaniard notably dropped Donnarumma for a game at Bayern Munich in November. Matvey Safonov, the Russian signed ahead of this season, took his place. ""I felt Safonov was better placed to deal with Bayern's pressing,"" insisted Enrique. Safonov was at fault for the goal which gave Bayern a 1-0 win, and Donnarumma was promptly restored to the team. The former AC Milan goalkeeper, who recently played his 150th game for PSG, now hopes to stay at the club beyond 2026. ""I am keen to stay and extend my contract because this is my home,"" he said earlier this year. Before thinking about the long-term future, however, Donnarumma and PSG have a Champions League final to aim for.",NA

The Gunners head to Parc des Princes faced with the daunting task of having to beat the French champions to reach the Champions League final for the second time in their history. Mikel Arteta's side trail 1-0 from the first leg after Ousmane Dembele's winner in north London. PSG have already eliminated Premier League champions Liverpool in the last 16 and Aston Villa in the quarter-finals, after beating Manchester City in the group phase. Arsenal, who have never won the Champions League, are on the brink of becoming PSG's latest English scalp this season after a disappointing first leg that could have ended in a heavier defeat. Their preparations for the second leg in Paris could not have gone much worse as they slumped to a 2-1 home defeat against Bournemouth in the Premier League Saturday.  Arteta said Arsenal were full of ""rage and anger"" after two painful losses. But Gunners captain Odegaard said they can use those emotions as fuel to inspire an epic victory over PSG - as long as there are no recriminations over the badly-timed slump. ""We're disappointed now, but we have to move on and be strong and stick together and prepare for a massive game,"" Odegaard said. ""It's a massive game. That's the good thing. When you're disappointed now and you're angry and frustrated, you can use all those emotions into Wednesday. ""We know what we're playing for. We have to stick together and create energy and be ready."" Arteta's decision to make just two changes against Bournemouth raised eyebrows as he risked the fitness of his key players. Only Jurrien Timber and Mikel Merino did not face the Cherries, with Arteta revealing the Dutch defender faces a fitness test before his availability for the PSG clash is decided. Second-placed Arsenal still need two wins from their last three league games to secure qualification for next season's Champions League. But it is the current edition of the tournament that has Arsenal's attention for now. After finishing as Premier League runners-up to City for the previous two seasons, Arsenal's failure to win a first title since 2004 weighs heavily on Arteta and his players. Injuries and inconsistent form from their forwards stopped Arsenal keeping pace with champions Liverpool. Without a trophy since winning the 2020 FA Cup, Arteta is desperate to turn Arsenal's undoubted quality into the tangible reward of silverware. Arsenal eliminated holders Real Madrid in this season's Champions League quarter-final with a superb 5-1 aggregate triumph. But the north Londoners' European history is littered with disappointment. Arsenal's last European trophy came when Alan Smith scored the winner against Parma in the 1994 Cup Winners' Cup final. Arsene Wenger's reign brought countless trophies, but their two European finals under the Frenchman ended in defeat to Galatasaray in the 2000 UEFA Cup and against Barcelona in the 2006 Champions League. Arsenal also lost the 2019 Europa League final to Chelsea in Unai Emery's brief spell in charge. It is that 1994 Cup Winners' Cup success for George Graham's men that Arsenal hope will prove a good omen for Wednesday's game. The Gunners were underdogs in the semi-final 31 years ago against a PSG side featuring George Weah and David Ginola, but emerged with a 2-1 aggregate victory. If Arsenal can overturn the deficit against the current PSG generation, it will go down as one of the greatest results in the club's history. Arteta's rallying cry left no doubt about what is at stake. ""What we have created now is a lot of rage, anger, frustration and a bad feeling in the tummy,"" he said.  ""So make sure we use that for Wednesday to have a massive performance in Paris, win the game and be in the final.""",NA

A versatile all-rounder, Miraz shone for Bangladesh in the Test series against Zimbabwe. The 27-year old was in form in both the Tests played. In the first Test at Sylhet, he was in good touch with the ball as he took back-to-back five-wicket hauls. He picked up 5/52 in the first innings and 5/50 in the second innings to keep the hosts in the contest, even though Zimbabwe eventually overcame the onslaught to secure a three-wicket victory. The second Test was one to remember for Miraz as he found his rhythm with both bat and ball. After Zimbabwe had been bowled out for a modest total in the first innings, Miraz scored 104 off 162 balls in the first innings to anchor the Bangladesh batting effort and further its advantage. He followed it up with another five-wicket haul in Zimbabwe's second innings and recorded figure of 5/32 as Bangladesh tied the series with a win by an innings and 106 runs in Chittagong. Miraz finished April with 116 runs in two Tests at an average of 38.66 and 15 wickets at an average of 11.86 in a spectacular month for the all-rounder.",NA

Md Rubel Islam, a student at UCEP Bangladesh, lamented the lack of practical skills and asked for more opportunities to connect with employers. “Is there any communication between the education system and industry to keep youth up to date on employment requirements?”  He called for initiatives that would ensure the skills youth are acquiring can be used in the labour market. Lily Prue Marma from Chittagong Hill tracts highlighted challenges indigenous peoples face, including lack of training and job opportunities, geographical and language barriers, calling for affirmative action and accountability to ensure their inclusion.  The dialogue, organized by ILO, the Bangladesh Business and Disability Network and Bonhishikha to commemorate Labour Day, highlighted the importance of inclusion in the labour market and celebrated voices of resilience and change in the workplace.  “We gather to recognise the resilience, ambition, and rights of all workers, especially those whose voices have too often gone unheard. The importance of equal opportunities for all women and men cannot be overstated as Bangladesh charts a new future for its people,” said ILO’s Country Director Tuomo Poutiainen.  The event heard from inspiring women and men from marginalized groups who are making it big in business and breaking through workplace barriers to make their contribution to society and the economy. Speakers acknowledged that discrimination persists, structurally and unconsciously, calling for clear policies and a change in culture and mindsets.  “Effective inclusion can only be achieved on the basis of labour rights; this must be the foundation of inclusion and equality,” said Badal Khan, workers’ representative and Chairman of the National Coordination Committee for Workers’ Education (NCCWE). The Bangladesh Employers’ Federation’s Vice-President, Tahmid Ahmed, emphasized: “Inclusion must go beyond policy; It must be part of the workplace culture that affords dignity and protection to all workers. The stories we have heard today inspire us to do more to build inclusive workplaces.” “Inclusive labour markets are not just a development goal, but a question of dignity and equity as well as economic and social justice for everyone. Inclusion not only benefits individuals, but it also strengthens entire communities and economies,” said AHM Shafiuzzaman, the secretary, Ministry of Labour and Employment. Sharmeen S Murshid, advisor, Ministry of Women and Children Affairs and Ministry of Social Welfare, highlighted the issue of women’s safety at home, during commutes to and from work, and at work as a key factor for inclusion of women in the workforce. “There is a big gap in public transportation and at the workplace where sexual harassment is rampant, which requires policy reforms to guarantee the safety of women in the world of work,” said Sharmeen S Murshid. We are reviewing how to make stronger policies and ensure their implementation in every institution and organization.” Labour Adviser Brigadier General (ret) Dr M Sakhawat Hussain closed the dialogue emphasizing enforcement of the law, especially in the issue of sexual violence and harassment of women, saying the consequences for such actions would be dire.",NA

From using art as a form of escapism to accomplishing his dreams, he is only at the beginning of his journey and has already done what others can only dream off. In an interview with Dhaka tribune, he helped us dive into in thoughts and talked about his dreams and experience. How did you get into filmmaking? In 2012, I got into college, Birshrestha Noor Mohammad Public College. My family shifted from Comilla to Dhaka at that time and I really couldn't match up with the Dhaka boys and wanted to find some form of art as a form of escapism. Reading books, writing stories, watching films and then altogether I got interested in writing film scripts. I started watching a lot of films via the suggestions of the film groups of Facebook such as 'Cinemakhor', 'Cinemakhorder adda' and by watching films I felt like I too can make films and then I wanted to study more about it. Then in 2015 I got into the  Television and Film Studies of University of Dhaka and now I am here.   What is your prior experience in this field? In 2016 I started working as an AD for Sankha Dasgupta and Ahmed Hasan Sunny for a few days. They together had a production house back then, I am sorry I forgot the name of it. And then in 2018, I became an intern AD for Half Stop Down under the supervision of Amitabh Reza Chowdhury. I couldn't stay there for long either as my studies were hampering. I shot, edited and directed a film named 'MRP', which got selected at Nepal's Ekadeshma International Film Festival's 'Made in Bangladesh' corner. Among the 12 films that got selected, I was the youngest director at that time. The same film was selected at the International Film Festival of South Asia, Toronto, Canada in 2018. I made this film inside my own room at Dhaka, just by following my brother. The film cost was literally nothing. And after coming here in our first year, everyone has to direct at least one film, I too made one, which got selected at IIUSFF, Dhaka and later at Dhaka Intl. Film Festival, but I had to withdraw the selection as they needed Bangladesh Premiere status, which I didn't have as I already screened my film at IIUSFF, Dhaka.   How did SAFTI help you in this journey? SRFTI has a beautiful campus I must say. Kolkata already has a lot less noise than Dhaka and SRFTI campus have even lesser sound pollution. So it helps us to think about our stories and discuss among the people who come from different parts of the world. Even in India there are lots of languages among them. Hearing those languages, their stories sort of trigger our memories of similar sorts of stories which help us write better scripts I feel. Other than that, SRFTI has really good technical departments. Editing, Cinematography, Sound - these three departments are equipped with the best possible equipment along with the very talented teachers. As the teachers are already established filmmakers, this encourages us even more.   What does the Cannes selection mean for Bangladeshi films? I think all the film students, film enthusiasts who are a bit skeptical about if they should join the journey of filmmaking, this news should inspire and encourage them. I personally have been discouraged a lot for getting into filmmaking yet I stuck onto it hoping one day I might get success. I didn't keep myself occupied into the typical TVC syndicate area. I studied more, I continuously tried for more and eventually I got this. This took me a lot of patience, suffering, tolerating everyone else's comment but yeah, I was committed on my journey. Still a lot of journeys need to be covered. I am yet to work on a proper good feature film. I have my own stories to tell, so I am hoping to start on my feature film script as well, as soon as possible. Other than me, there are three more Bangladeshi students studying here in my batch, together I think we can help, encourage and inspire any newcomer who is passionate about filmmaking.   What advice would you give someone who wants to pursue this line of work? Keep patience and also there was a viral folk song which had two lines that's very much needed in this field. ""O manush, manush, tomar duto kana ar duto chokh. Dekhba ar shunba.Kintu ekta much toh, ektu kotha kom koba"" (translation: Oh human, human you have two ears and two eyes. You see and hear. But you have one mouth, you speak a little less."") Rather than talking a lot, people need to listen and observe more. Not just other people, knowing your own self is the hardest and most important to understand other's emotions. Only after that we can form our own stories. Other than that, it's not always needed to work with expensive film cameras, sound devices or editing software. Everyone has a smartphone these days, if someone wants to make a film, just take out your phone and start shooting like the way you always wanted to. Then try to make a narrative out of those footage in the editing table. And the sound too may follow or not follow the footage all the time. This should be the filmmaker's own creative choice. In our leisure time we have made films in this way and those too got selected into foreign film festivals. Obviously those are not something like Cannes, but we kept on our practices which eventually led us to the one from which we are getting the recognition, finally. With his wealth of knowledge and such nuanced perspective on the world, art creators like him give the future generations hope and drive. It’s only a matter of time he reaches new heights.",NA

The 5 short films are 'In the sky' produced by Ahsan Shoron, 'Subroto Sengupta' directed by Abir Ferdous Mukhar, 'The Sky Gets Gloomy at Night' by Mahmudul Hasan Adnan, ‘Revival' produced by Mahmud Hasan and 'the home in sound’ directed by Fuaduzzaman Fuad. For some time now,  Chorki has been planning to create opportunities for new and young filmmakers. The platform's CEO, Redoan Rony, said, ""Usually, it is seen that short films made by young people are focused on film festivals or have to be shown to a specific audience. After that, there is no way to show or watch them. Chorki's initiative is to create that opportunity."" Chorki's Lead Business and Growth Faisal Rahman confirmed that this effort will continue with young producers and artists. He said, ""In addition to encouraging the youth and recognizing their work, we want to create new audiences."" Chorki's Creative Producer Al-Amin Hasan Nirjhar said that they have selected 5 short films with different stories and production styles from many short films. The teasers of the short films have already been released online. Viewers expressed their appreciation and good wishes in the comments section. The short film ‘in the sky’ is a dramatic-comedy. The story is about a young man named Nuruddin's dream of going to the sky. Its director Ahsan Samran said, 'My film Akashe (In The Sky) has been released on Chorki, I have no happier news than this. I respect this initiative of Chorki. It will inspire many new filmmakers like me to do great work.' The short film 'Subrata Sengupta' is based on the screenplay of the late filmmaker Tarek Masud. Director Abir Ferdous Mukhar said, 'I was fortunate to work at the Tarek Masud Memorial Trust for a few days. That's where I first came across this screenplay. We started this work with the permission of Catherine Masud. We have added our own ideas while maintaining the atmosphere of the original script.' This short film gradually reveals how various factors such as family, society, love, religion, and politics influenced Subrata Sengupta's life in the late nineties. 'The Sky Gets Gloomy at Night' is a short drama . Its director Mahmudul Hasan Adnan said, ""After almost three years of making, my work 'The Sky Gloomy at Night' is going to reach everyone through Chorki. Which is a moment of great joy for me. I hope that the release of my film will lead me to the next film."" Due to unwanted mistakes and betrayals, a cruel reality descends on Beaver's personal, family and social life. From there, ‘Eevival' is made about the story of starting over. Its director Mahmud Hasan said, 'I feel quite confident in giving Chorki the responsibility of showing the face of my first child in front of the audience.' The story of 'The Home in Sound' is built on the difficult struggle between friendship and dreams and reality. Its director Fuad said, ""Our journey is mainly in the coastal region where we wanted to say, the sea that saves our lives, the sea that consumes our lives. Our film was released on Chorki and I think Chorki is going to start a new journey for short films in Bangladesh.""",NA

Survival through teamwork: It's a tale as old as time with particular resonance today, says Argentine actor Ricardo Darin of his latest project ""The Eternaut,"" which hit Netflix on Wednesday.   Based on a 1950s comic with iconic status in the South American country, the sci-fi series tells the story of a mysterious, toxic snowfall that precedes an alien invasion of Buenos Aires.   More elementally, it is about ordinary people with few resources and no special powers who collectively stare down a totalitarian threat, Darin, 68, told AFP in an interview.   ""The communities that managed to survive were those that stood shoulder to shoulder, defended themselves, and did not care only about what happened to them individually,"" he said of the storyline.   In this way, the series ""resonates"" with the present, said Darin, though he declined to specify which threat in particular he was referring to.   Directed and scripted by Argentina's Bruno Stagnaro, ""The Eternaut"" is based on the comic by the same name serialized by writer Hector Oesterheld and illustrator Francisco Solano Lopez between 1957 and 1959.   Oesterheld took the series up again in the 1960s, with ever-more political overtones that are believed to have contributed to his kidnapping in 1977 under Argentina's brutal military dictatorship.   He was never heard from again, nor were his four daughters and three sons-in-law, all of whom figure among the estimated 30,000 people listed as ""disappeared"" by agents of the dictatorship, according to rights groups.   - 'Very, very hard work' - Darin, known for his roles in the films ""Nine Queens,"" ""Wild Tales,"" and ""The Secret in Their Eyes"" -- which won the Oscar for best international feature in 2010 -- said he was scared at first of playing Juan Salvo, the resistance hero in ""The Eternaut.""   He had no background in science fiction and had to do demanding stunts.   ""Physically it was very, very hard work,"" the actor said.   ""Each day, the end of filming found us exhausted, and with little recovery time.""   Darin took part in 113 of the 148 days of shooting, often decked out in Salvo's heavy snow-proof outfit on sets covered with tons of cumbersome artificial snow.   ""Not to mention the things that happen in an action shoot, where you have to roll, jump, fall, crash, fight; a series of things that when you're 25 or 30 years old, it's nothing, but for me, who is 114..."" he laughed.   Darin is hopeful the series will be a boost for Argentine cinema at a time the government of budget-slashing President Javier Milei has withdrawn state support for the National Institute of Cinema and Audiovisual Arts, and for culture in general.   ""Nothing like this has ever been done here,"" said Darin of the project.",NA
