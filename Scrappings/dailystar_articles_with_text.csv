Dhaka Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Mohammad Mostafizur Rahman passed the order after hearing her bail petition, Nusraat lawyer Mohammad Iftekhar Hossain told The Daily Star. Yesterday, she was sent to jail in connection with the case. The court yesterday set May 22 to hear the bail petition after her lawyer Iftekhar submitted her travel documents and said that she had been in Canada between July 9 and August 13, when the offence occurred in Dhaka's Bhatara area. The arrest has drawn widespread criticism from artistes and cultural figures, especially those who were vocal during the July uprising. The actor was escorted to the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate's Court in Dhaka amid tight security around 10:00am yesterday, a day after she was arrested at Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport before boarding a flight. On March 27 this year, one Enamul Haque, who suffered bullet injuries on July 19 last year during the protests in Bhatara, filed the case with the court against deposed prime minister Sheikh Hasina, 17 actors, and 265 others. On April 29, the officer-in-charge of Bhatara Police Station registered it as a First Information Report in line with the court's directive. নুসরাত ফারিয়াকে আজ মঙ্গলবার সকালে জামিন দেওয়া হয়।",2025-05-20T10:31:21+06:00
https://www.thedailystar.net//news/bangladesh/news/star-interview-betting-leaner-budget-3898646,Star Interview: Betting on a leaner budget,https://www.thedailystar.net//news/bangladesh/news/star-interview-betting-leaner-budget-3898646,"Bangladesh's interim government is preparing a tighter budget to rein in the fiscal deficit while boosting job creation and stabilising the economy amid mounting debt concerns. ""It's not that we won't borrow from foreign and local sources, but we'll bring the amount down,"" Finance Adviser Salehuddin Ahmed said in an exclusive interview with The Daily Star on Sunday. A key objective is to reduce the country's debt risk from ""moderate"" to ""lower"", Ahmed said, adding, ""We'll try our best to reduce the budget deficit significantly."" While cutting administrative expenses is difficult, the government plans to curb expenditure by dropping large, capital-intensive infrastructure projects. Ahmed said the government would avoid costly ventures like Payra Port, which requires Tk 200 crore in annual dredging with limited returns. However, select investments such as the Bay Terminal and the metro rail, each costing around $700-800 million, will move forward. The government aims to place greater emphasis on labour-intensive development activities, such as roadwork and river excavation, to stimulate the rural economy. ""We're looking at projects where local labour will be involved and the money will circulate at the local level. That's how we'll generate employment,"" said Ahmed, referring to his discussion with Chief Adviser Muhammad Yunus. ""We want employment to happen in agriculture and smaller projects, so the pressure on the budget will be less,"" he said. In parallel, Bangladesh Bank is placing special focus on providing targeted loan schemes to support women's participation in the economy. The forthcoming budget will also take a ""business-friendly"" approach, according to Ahmed. ""We'll try to encourage the private sector. We also want to graduate to a phase that increases competitiveness."" Revenue mobilisation will be strengthened through a sweeping review of tax exemptions. ""There are many exemptions, waivers given. Many charitable organisations -- we've cut all tax exemptions,"" he said. ""We'll recognise genuine charitable organisations and hospitals, but the rest will go. That will generate significant tax revenue."" On value-added tax, Ahmed confirmed that the standard 15 percent VAT rate will remain in place, but some flexibility will be introduced. The government plans to lower VAT for production-oriented sectors to keep costs down. For the service sector, such as restaurants, he argued, VAT is more affordable. ""If someone spends Tk 500, they can pay VAT,"" he said. The budget will also address broader social and developmental goals. ""We'll increase spending in education, health, and social safety nets,"" said Ahmed. ""We're putting an emphasis on self-employment. Not everyone will just look for jobs -- those who are motivated should be able to create their own livelihoods."" The next budget will make a symbolic shift by recognising the role of domestic workers. ""We'll mention domestic workers in the budget. They are part of the productive force. Their contribution hasn't been counted so far, but if we monetise it, it will be quite significant,"" Ahmed said, adding that formal GDP inclusion might happen in future. Inflation, while still elevated, is expected to ease in the coming months. ""Inflation is now decreasing, though slowly,"" he said. ""We hope it will come down to 6.5 percent next year."" The budget will be televised on June 2. A public feedback period will follow, allowing possible revisions before it is finalised and enacted through an ordinance. Some budgetary measures will take effect immediately. To support its fiscal programme, the government expects to secure approximately $3.5 billion in budget support from global lenders by June or July. That includes $1.3 billion from the International Monetary Fund. The total excludes project loans, Ahmed clarified. In the infrastructure pipeline, the Rooppur nuclear power project is nearing completion. ""Rooppur is more than 80 percent complete, and uranium is already in storage,"" Ahmed said, adding that trial generation is expected to begin by September or October, with one unit slated to become fully operational by year-end. The second unit has reached roughly 60 percent completion. Ahmed also stressed that the interim government intends to leave behind lasting institutional reforms for the next administration. ""One footprint is the NBR -- we've split it. That won't be reversed."" He pointed to several key structural reforms introduced through new ordinances. One outlines how troubled banks can be restructured or liquidated to safeguard depositors. ""The ordinance aims to ensure that people's savings and deposits are protected, and that there's a clear process for returning them,"" said Ahmed. Another ordinance aims to improve transparency in the public accounts of authorities. A separate regulation ensures that official statistics are published without political interference. ""There will be a committee; they will work independently; nobody will interfere with the figures they provide,"" Ahmed said. নুসরাত ফারিয়াকে আজ মঙ্গলবার সকালে জামিন দেওয়া হয়।",2025-05-20T00:10:38+06:00

https://www.thedailystar.net//business/news/debates-over-leasing-nct-foreign-operator-intensifying-3898686,Debates over leasing NCT to foreign operator intensifying,https://www.thedailystar.net//business/news/debates-over-leasing-nct-foreign-operator-intensifying-3898686,"The debate over whether to lease out the New Mooring Container Terminal (NCT) at Chittagong Port to a foreign operator is intensifying, with political parties, including the BNP, Jamaat-e-Islami, and left-leaning groups, uniting in opposition. The move, initially introduced under the previous Awami League government through the Public Private Partnership (PPP) Authority, has gained traction under the current interim government. While some political and labour groups are vocal in their opposition, authorities say that a feasibility study is ongoing, with the final decision to be based on its findings. However, Shipping Adviser Brig Gen (Retd) M Sakhawat Hussain indicated that the administration is in favour of bringing in a foreign operator to manage the terminal. Opposition parties argue that the NCT is already well-equipped and capable of delivering world-class services without external involvement. They claim there is no scope for expansion, making foreign investment ""unnecessary"" and appointing a foreign operator ""irrational"". Completed in 2007 at a cost of Tk 469 crore, the 950-metre-long NCT has five jetties -- four for ocean-going vessels and one for smaller ships on inland routes. 'What's the point of leasing out a functional terminal?' Humayun Kabir, former publicity secretary of BNP's labour wing Jatiyatabadi Sramik Dal (Port unit), said that the Chittagong Port Authority (CPA) invested Tk 2,000 crore to fully equip the terminal. Now, he argued, there is little left to invest in. Since 2007, local firm Saif Powertec Ltd had been running two of the jetties of the NCT on an ad hoc basis. In 2015, the CPA formally appointed Saif Powertec as the operator for four jetties. Kabir criticised the appointment as being ""politically motivated"" and argued that if a new operator is to be selected, it should be done transparently through an open tender. ""Leasing out NCT to a foreign operator would drain revenue from a fully operational terminal,"" he claimed. According to the CPA, the NCT generated Tk 1,216 crore in revenue in FY23, with net income after expenses amounting to Tk 574 crore. In the same period, Saif Powertec received Tk 79.13 crore as handling charges. Jamaat-e-Islami city unit Ameer Shahjahan Chowdhury echoed Kabir's concerns. He said, ""We are not against foreign investment. But bring foreign investment for greenfield projects, for new ports and terminals; not for an already established terminal."" For the construction and operation of the proposed Bay Terminal and Laldia Container Terminal, the previous Awami League government started talks with global operators including PSA Singapore, DP World, AP Moller Maersk and Abu Dhabi Port. In 2023, the previous government leased out the newly built Patenga Container Terminal (PCT) to Saudi firm Red Sea Gateway Terminal (RSGT) International for 22 years. However, all those moves involving foreign companies did not face that much opposition. Push for foreign investment During a recent visit to the Chittagong Port, Bangladesh Investment Development Authority (Bida) Executive Chairman Chowdhury Ashik Mahmud Bin Harun stressed the need for global operators to manage port facilities, citing efficiency and optimal utilisation as key to transforming Bangladesh into a global manufacturing hub. ""With limited land, we must ensure that every port facility operates as one of the world's best,"" he said. ""Otherwise, we won't achieve our ambitions."" CPA Chairman Rear Admiral SM Moniruzzaman also supported the move, saying that a global operator could introduce advanced technology and increase efficiency through competition. ""Appointing a foreign operator could maximise financial returns while modernising port operations,"" he said. Political pressure foiled initial foreign operator plan After the NCT's construction was completed in 2007, the CPA floated an international tender to appoint a foreign operator. However, then shipping minister Shahjahan Khan and Chairman of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Shipping Nur-e-Alam Chowdhury intervened, leading to the tender's cancellation. The CPA then opted to equip the terminal using its own funds and appointed a local operator. The terminal remained underutilised for eight years after construction. By 2022, it had its key equipment installed. In 2022, talks to appoint a foreign operator at the NCT started. Salman F Rahman, the then private industry and investment adviser to the prime minister, was in favour of leasing out NCT to DP World. In March 2023, the then Awami League government approved the appointment of an international private operator for operation and maintenance of NCT under Public Private Partnership. নুসরাত ফারিয়াকে আজ মঙ্গলবার সকালে জামিন দেওয়া হয়।",2025-05-20T00:00:00+06:00
https://www.thedailystar.net//opinion/editorial/news/public-procurement-process-must-be-fair-and-competitive-3898771,Public procurement process must be fair and competitive,https://www.thedailystar.net//opinion/editorial/news/public-procurement-process-must-be-fair-and-competitive-3898771,"A recent roundtable discussion on the public procurement process in Bangladesh has again brought to light issues that have long been raised but sadly remain unresolved. The event, attended by local industrialists, procurement experts, and government officials, highlighted how the existing procurement framework sidelines local manufacturers in favour of foreign experts and companies, limiting their ability to compete for government contracts. Some participants called the procurement rules ""discriminatory,"" as they allegedly lock out well-established local companies from a government spending pool worth $30 billion.  They also pointed out that the existing rules neither ensure full transparency nor guarantee fair competition. There were instances where domestic bidders were reportedly rejected for invalid reasons. This lack of competitiveness has been an issue for long, with a recent Transparency International Bangladesh (TIB) study revealing that over the last 12 years, more than 62 percent of tenders went to just five percent of contractors. The introduction of the electronic government procurement (e-GP) system—which was intended to address such irregularities and promote fair bidding—has failed to make a difference. In 2023, TIB found that public contracts worth Tk 60,069 crore were awarded based on single bids through the e-GP system. How is that possible if the system isn't being manipulated? The role of Bangladesh Competition Commission in addressing such malpractice has been questionable, to say the least.  Over the years, Bangladesh's manufacturing base has grown significantly in several sectors. We now have multibillion-dollar industries that have successfully expanded operations in multiple countries. This should give them ample expertise to participate in domestic projects—provided the process is transparent, competitive, and merit-based. The engagement of local companies also helps boost domestic expertise and revenue. In the process, local manufacturing can receive a strong push, creating jobs, saving valuable foreign currency currently spent on hiring foreign firms, and making meaningful contributions to the national economy.  Unfortunately, corruption in public projects remains a grave concern that needs urgent intervention. According to TIB, around 27 percent of government contracts involve corruption. Overinflated cost estimates regularly make headlines. For instance, in 2023, the state-run Power Grid Company of Bangladesh Ltd (PGCBL) reportedly imported 68 kg of tower bolts, nuts, and washers from India for $239,695, when the actual price should have been a mere $148! Examples like this are far too common.  Clearly, the public procurement system is in urgent need of an overhaul. We hope the interim government will take necessary steps to introduce long-overdue reforms to make public procurement fair, transparent, efficient, and corruption-free. নুসরাত ফারিয়াকে আজ মঙ্গলবার সকালে জামিন দেওয়া হয়।",2025-05-20T10:00:14+06:00
https://www.thedailystar.net//opinion/views/news/why-job-creation-must-come-first-3898321,Why job creation must come first,https://www.thedailystar.net//opinion/views/news/why-job-creation-must-come-first-3898321,"In Bangladesh, the economy grows, flyovers rise, export numbers impress, and yet the average citizen stares blankly at their plate, wondering how to make groceries last the week. It is the great national contradiction: GDP goes up but job security goes down. Economic success stories echo in the halls of power, but the garment workers in the narrow alleys of Mohammadpur, the fresh graduates in Natore, and the rickshaw pullers in Cumilla are all asking the same thing: where are the sustainable jobs? The truth is, we have perfected the art of looking developed without actually becoming it. Our problems aren't hard to diagnose. Nearly 20 lakh young people enter the labour force every year, yet formal job creation trails far behind. According to the latest quarterly labour force survey by the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (BBS), the unemployment rate has reached 4.63 percent, the highest in recent years. Besides, informal employment makes up over 80 percent of the labour market. Automation, climate migration, lack of upskilling, gender exclusion, and concentration of opportunities in urban areas have made this labour market not just tight, but unjust. What makes this particularly painful is that Bangladesh is not short of talent, ambition, or work ethic. What it lacks is a system that knows how to convert that into meaningful employment. Instead, we hand out certificates without purpose and diplomas without direction. Across slums and suburbs, young people with degrees are waiting to be useful, watching their potential rot under the pressure of parental expectations, rising food prices, and the suffocating stasis of doing nothing in a country that always claims it's doing everything.  So, let's talk about the real story: jobs—not one-off projects, not Facebook training workshops, not the kind of ""entrepreneurship"" where the youth are told to sell pickles online for ""self-reliance,"" but actual, living-wage, future-ready jobs. We need a serious national strategy, not sloganeering. And that starts with understanding who needs jobs and what's stopping them. For those in the working class—garment workers, domestic workers, small traders—the hurdle is not just low wages, but zero protection. There is no social safety net if they fall ill, no pension, no legal recourse if they're cheated. These are the hands that run our economy, but they are treated as disposable. Legal reform, minimum wage guarantees, and union protections are not luxuries; they are the foundation of justice in a labour market. For educated youth, the problem is even more sinister. Years of public money are spent educating them, only for the state to shrug when they graduate. What should they do? Join a political rally in exchange for lunch money? Compete for a public sector job where the recruitment board changes rules mid-exam? Or dream of Dubai while they tutor O Level students to pay their loan instalments? Meanwhile, rural youth are either forced into unsafe migration or absorbed into unpaid family labour. Climate migrants—those pushed off their land by rising salinity and cyclones—add to the ranks of the jobless in cities already bursting at the seams. Women, especially in conservative and rural settings, are simply not allowed to work or cannot find safe, flexible options. What they all need is a government that listens, and not just before elections. Recently, Tarique Rahman, acting chairperson of BNP, released a 31-point reform plan that, for all its politics, at least puts jobs where they belong: at the centre. Unemployment allowances for educated youth? About time. Investment in decentralised agro-industries? Necessary. Rebuilding institutions to ensure merit-based recruitment? Revolutionary, if done sincerely. But what's more important than individual party promises is this: whoever comes to power next must stop treating employment like an afterthought to economic growth. It is the centrepiece that will stabilise the country, combat rising crime rates, and curtail the chaos.  The new government must begin with a national employment guarantee framework, particularly in rural and climate-affected zones. It must invest in large-scale public works that not only create jobs but solve real problems: canals, climate-resilient housing, and rural transport, among others. It must reform vocational education with real world partnerships. It must reward small businesses that hire locally and formalise informal sectors through incentives, not punishment. In short, we need jobs for all: for the man fixing your tyre in Mirpur, for the woman sewing blouses in Badda, for the graduate with no network in Rajshahi, and for the slum child who just wants to go to school so they can someday work with dignity. These aren't demands, they are rights. All the reform commissions and their timelines might be resultantly futile if, in the next five years, Bangladesh cannot address the issue of sustainable livelihood.  Without jobs, no amount of infrastructure will save us. What's the point of a six-lane highway if the only traffic it carries is outbound flights of our brightest minds? What use is a smart city when its residents are too broke to afford broadband internet? A state that cannot provide work is not a prospering state. It is a waiting room for disillusionment. And when disillusionment reaches its limit, it doesn't stay quiet. So, before we build another monument, another megaproject, another symbol, let's do the one thing that truly builds a country: give its people a chance to work, earn, and live with dignity. Otherwise, it's all flyovers to nowhere. Barrister Noshin Nawal is an activist, feminist, and a columnist for The Daily Star. She can be reached at [email protected].

https://www.thedailystar.net//opinion/views/news/tariffs-and-trade-wars-bangladeshs-path-new-geo-economic-order-3898311,Tariffs and trade wars: Bangladesh’s path in a new geo-economic order,https://www.thedailystar.net//opinion/views/news/tariffs-and-trade-wars-bangladeshs-path-new-geo-economic-order-3898311,"The trade war between the US and China has become a significant topic of discussion among policymakers and academics since Donald Trump took office in 2025. It started during Trump 1.0, continued under President Joe Biden, and further expanded under the Trump 2.0 era. Trade policy pundits argue that these policies have been criticised globally. However, analysis of American industrial history, economic prosperity, and the current state of international trade imbalances can broaden our perspective on the trade war and American policies. Reindustrialisation, entrepreneurship, innovation, and creating opportunities for millions of individuals have become crucial for developed economies. The trade war of Trump 2.0 will likely remain active in the coming years and affect global value chains (GVCs). Economies across the globe might reconfigure their participation in GVCs by re-orchestrating their downstream and upstream involvement depending on each economy's context. The global production networks need to consider economic efficiency, productivity, optimisation of resources and strategies, and geo-economic and geopolitical realities. China has shown resilience and successfully reconfigured its value chains since the trade war of Trump 1.0. However, not all economies have the free hand and resources to do so. China was the largest source of imports to the US until 2022, capturing 21 percent of the import share. Since then, China has reduced its exports to this market by diverting and increasing its exports to non-US and non-EU markets in the Global South. They have also invested heavily in developing their technological prowess under the ""Made in China 2025"" policy and the Belt and Road Initiative. Bangladesh, not possessing all of China's capabilities, can learn from China's experience and reformulate international trade strategies for geographical and product diversification. Thanks to its participation in GVCs, Bangladesh has become the second-largest exporter of RMG. The imposition of tariffs has created panic among the RMG industry, policymakers, and other stakeholders. Even before the start of the trade war, Bangladesh's RMG industry faced serious challenges, such as low-cost and labour-intensive manufacturing, highly concentrated export markets, intermediate component and raw material sourcing, political uncertainty, graduation to a lower-middle-income country, and loss of advantages as a least developing economy. Bangladesh should diversify its intermediate components and raw materials sourcing instead of relying on only China and India. This could involve enhancing trade relations with Pakistan, Central Asian countries, Southeast Asian countries, and the US. Many Central American countries use American cotton to produce RMG products and export them to the US in a duty-free and quota-free mode. This strategy could lessen the trade deficit and encourage American policymakers to reconsider tariff levels for Bangladesh. Demonstrating a sincere effort in reducing trade deficits and strengthening partnerships in the geo-economic and geo-political arena, including in the Indo-Pacific area, might lead the US to reconsider the tariff issue, offer Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) facilities, and attract more American investment and technology transfers. Bangladesh's economy and the current administration are facing challenges due to the US tariff imposition, though based on a flawed measurement. The current market dynamics and restructuring of the GVCs have led to a shift in the RMG sector from low-cost, low-tech, and labour-intensive business models to high-tech and higher value-added products. To survive and prosper in this competitive business ecosystem, the government should play the role of promoter by developing specific initiatives and strategies that encourage, enable, and encourage the RMG sector to come out of the low-cost, low-tech, and labour-intensive business models. Bangladesh can attract firms quitting the Chinese and Vietnamese markets by developing the skills and productivity of its employees, investing in advanced technologies, and creating a welcoming business environment. Public policies should focus on improving the manufacturing ecosystem so that firms from other countries choose Bangladesh as their production hub to export to global markets. The competitiveness of RMG products depends not only on the cost of labour but also on the physical and soft infrastructure, both formal and informal institutions, and on stimulating public policies. Improving infrastructures and institutions, including the smooth operation of seaports, shipping, customs administration, and banking services, can help RMG factories enhance their competitiveness. Bangladesh should diversify its export market to non-traditional markets, such as African, Middle Eastern, and South American markets, where there is a huge demand for low-cost, high-value RMG products. The interim government should discuss and negotiate with the two largest neighbouring markets, India and China, to remove non-tariff-related barriers (NTB) so Bangladeshi products can enter those markets without hassle. Bangladesh faces the prospect of losing several advantages it enjoys as a least developed country. To address this, the government should renegotiate or ask for a delay in applying tariffs once it graduates to a lower-middle-income country. For the medium and long term, Bangladesh must sign free trade agreements with leading export markets to make trade smoother. We must focus on upgrading the value ladder for our exportable products, diversifying product baskets, and ensuring technology transfer through international joint ventures and other equity investments. People generally do not like ""change"" and prefer to maintain the ""status quo,"" which leads to organisational inertia. Crisis and a chaotic environment bring opportunities to think freshly, introduce harsh reform, and rebuild organisations. The current global trade frictions can help create many opportunities for Bangladesh's manufacturing industry if proper reforms, investment in infrastructure and technology, and institutional policies are updated, and effectiveness is improved.

https://www.thedailystar.net//opinion/views/news/not-your-average-bmw-decoding-dhakas-rickshaw-kings-3898246,Not your average BMW: Decoding Dhaka's rickshaw kings,https://www.thedailystar.net//opinion/views/news/not-your-average-bmw-decoding-dhakas-rickshaw-kings-3898246,"When my travel agent mentioned I'd see many BMWs in Dhaka, I pictured sleek German engineering. Three days into the visit, I finally understood his joke. My introduction to Dhaka's transportation ecosystem began soon after leaving the airport. ""Don't worry about traffic laws,"" my driver cheerfully informed me, ""nobody else does!"" Already disoriented from the airport saga, I managed a nervous smile, unsure of what that meant. Ninety harrowing minutes and five kilometres later, I was no longer laughing. The true kings of Dhaka's roads aren't the buses, cars, or traditional rickshaws—they're the battery-powered rickshaws that swarm the streets, moving in random directions, often whooshing past like shooting stars. These three-wheeled chariots race at an impressive speed of 30 kilometres per hour, occupying every available inch of space and favouring the central segment traditionally reserved for faster vehicles (lanes don't exist on Dhaka roads). As a pedestrian, I am still learning what locals call ""rickshaw radar""—a sixth sense that warns me when one of these sleek missiles is about to appear from thin air. Once, after carefully analysing the surroundings, I was crossing the road when one such rickshaw appeared from nowhere, almost breathing down my neck. I jumped aside, only to find that the vehicle, upon reaching the other side, turned around and crossed the road again, as if taking a thoughtful stroll in its backyard! The simple act of exiting the car has become a heart-pounding adventure. You carefully open the door, scan in all directions, and still miss the super-rickshaw that whooshes past with mere centimetres to spare. What directional convention do they follow? I tried to figure that out, but had to give up. In all the countries I visited, vehicles typically follow predictable patterns—staying in lanes, signalling turns, and acknowledging right of way. Here, these omnipresent vehicles operate in four dimensions, appearing suddenly from the right, left, front, rear, and possibly alternate universes, usually without warning. ""But surely there are traffic regulations?"" I asked a colleague, who responded with laughter usually reserved for naive children. ""Look around you,"" he gestured broadly. ""Does this look regulated to you?"" He had a point. What I witnessed wasn't traffic so much as a perpetual negotiation conducted through honks, near-misses, and what appears to be telepathy. How the residents of Dhaka arrive anywhere alive remains one of the great mysteries of the modern world. The battery rickshaws themselves are a fascinating study in adaptation. Far from appearing primitive, many are equipped with sports-car-like digital displays, showing speed and battery levels. Some have bright LED lights, turn signals, and horns that could wake the dead. These aren't your grandfather's rickshaws—they're mini-vehicles with attitude. This attitude extends to their drivers, who perceive traffic police as mere decorative suggestions rather than authoritative figures. Once, when an officer attempted to clear battery rickshaws from a congested intersection, he found himself surrounded by dozens of angry drivers. The resulting ""discussion"" sent him to the hospital with minor injuries and a major reassessment of his career choices. (His wife has since filed a divorce suit because she had married him for his ""authoritative status,"" which was now lost.) These confrontations aren't isolated incidents. Battery rickshaw drivers have demonstrated an impressive ability for collective action. The upscale Gulshan neighbourhood recently attempted to ban these electric terrors from its main roads—a decision that sparked immediate outrage. Hundreds of furious drivers blocked access points to the area, creating traffic jams visible from the International Space Station. The police eventually dispersed them using methods I won't detail here, but the issue remains far from settled. What's remarkable is how Dhaka residents have normalised this daily ballet of near-death experiences. They navigate the chaos with an ease that suggests either Zen-like acceptance or complete fatalism. My local friends barely notice when I flinch at a rickshaw speeding by, close enough to count the driver's eyelashes. ""You'll get used to it,"" they assure me. I'm not convinced human beings should ""get used to"" traffic patterns that resemble a video game designed by sadistic nerds, but adaptation is apparently the only option. What about the mysterious BMW acronym that had me so confused? After several weeks in town, I learned it stands for ""Bismillah Motor Works""—a local manufacturer that produces these zippy electric cuties. And why not? Many of their drivers wear denim and T-shirts from reputable brands and sport aviator sunglasses thanks to the byproducts of Bangladesh's apparel industry and counterfeit market. For future travellers, I recommend excellent travel insurance, nerves of steel, and the acceptance that traffic rules are more like traffic suggestions—applicable only when convenient and generally ignored by the sleek BMWs of Bismillah Motor Works. They are a brilliant testament to Bangladesh's innovative minds. I only wish they followed predictable traffic rules!

Reportedly, the court sentenced 44-year-old Hitu Sheikh, the prime accused, to death for the rape and murder of his daughter-in-law's eight-year-old sister. However, three other accused were acquitted as the charges against them could not be proven beyond a reasonable doubt. That said, the surprising efficiency with which our judicial system worked in this case may serve as a model for future trials. After the verdict, the victim's mother was reported to have expressed disappointment over the acquittal of three accused, stating, ""They deserved punishment, as they assisted in the murder and concealed information."" We hope proper justice will be served if or when the case is appealed, but for the moment, what we should take away from this case is the speed with which the trial was conducted. The same urgency should be applied to the many other rape cases pending in courts across the country. As a Supreme Court lawyer rightly pointed out, inconsistency in the pace of justice leads to disparity and undermines public confidence in the judiciary. According to the Human Rights Support Society, at least 6,305 women and girls were raped in the past five years. Despite this alarming rate, conviction remains extremely low. Of the 20,914 cases of violence against women and children filed through 14 one-stop crisis centres between 2001 and July 2024, only 1.48 percent ended in convictions. Currently, 101 Women and Children Repression Prevention Tribunals are handling such cases, with each burdened by an average of 1,500 pending cases. To address this backlog, more tribunals must be established. Additionally, we must protect victims and witnesses as they are sometimes pressured into withdrawing cases or settling out of court. The longstanding problems of faulty investigations and inadequate forensic facilities should also be addressed through institutional reform. In our country, rape trials often drag on for years—even in lower courts. The swift verdict in the Magura case shows that timely justice is indeed possible. While we strongly support expediting investigations and trials, it is equally important that the process be thorough and fair. We urge the government to do everything in its power to ensure both speed and quality in justice delivery. নুসরাত ফারিয়াকে আজ মঙ্গলবার সকালে জামিন দেওয়া হয়।",2025-05-19T15:30:18+06:00
https://www.thedailystar.net//opinion/views/news/bangladeshs-strategic-tightrope-rakhine-3898131,Bangladesh’s strategic tightrope in Rakhine,https://www.thedailystar.net//opinion/views/news/bangladeshs-strategic-tightrope-rakhine-3898131,"In Myanmar's Rakhine State, where the Arakan Army (AA) has consolidated control over significant swathes of territory, an estimated 1.2 million people—Rohingya Muslims and ethnic Rakhine Buddhists—face severe food shortages amid escalating conflict. The UN warns of famine-like conditions, exacerbated by Myanmar's military junta blocking humanitarian access since 2023. For Bangladesh, which already hosts over 960,000 Rohingya refugees (UNHCR, 2023), a proposal to open a cross-border aid channel has sparked fierce debate. The channel, first proposed by the UN in early 2024, is framed as a lifeline for starving civilians. Yet critics argue it risks drawing Bangladesh into Myanmar's civil war, complicating relations with regional powers like China and India, and inflaming domestic political tensions. As former Bangladeshi Foreign Secretary Shahidul Haque noted in a 2024 interview with The Daily Star, ""Humanitarian gestures can become geopolitical traps if divorced from hard-nosed realism."" This op-ed examines Bangladesh's precarious balancing act through the lens of offensive realism—the theory that states prioritise survival in an anarchic international system—while advocating for a strategy that blends principled aid with safeguards for sovereignty. The origins of the channel: Humanitarianism or realpolitik?
 The proposal for a Bangladesh-Myanmar aid channel is rooted in a decade of failed diplomacy. Since 2017, when Myanmar's military expelled over 740,000 Rohingya, Dhaka has repeatedly urged the UN Security Council to enforce repatriation. Instead, geopolitical gridlock—notably China and Russia shielding Myanmar from sanctions—has left Bangladesh bearing what former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina called a ""uniquely disproportionate burden."" By 2023, donor fatigue had set in. The UN's $876 million Rohingya response plan was only 40 percent funded (UNOCHA, 2023), forcing ration cuts in Cox's Bazar camps. Meanwhile, Myanmar's civil war escalated, with the AA seizing key towns in Rakhine and Chin States. The UN's 2024 appeal for cross-border aid from Bangladesh emerged as a pragmatic workaround, but one laden with risks. Myanmar's junta, which brands the AA a terrorist group, has weaponised aid access. After Cyclone Mocha devastated Rakhine in May 2023, the military blocked relief to AA-held areas, worsening malnutrition rates. The AA, while claiming to welcome aid, faces allegations of diverting supplies. A June 2023 report by the International Crisis Group documented AA checkpoints taxing commercial goods in Chin State, raising fears that aid convoys could face similar exploitation. For Bangladesh, the channel offers leverage. By conditioning aid on Rohingya repatriation talks, Dhaka seeks to shift global attention to Myanmar's atrocities. Yet as one security analyst warned, ""Humanitarian aid cannot be transactional. If politicised, it will fail civilians and backfire on Bangladesh."" Stakeholders' chessboard: Who wins, who loses?
 Bangladesh's interim government faces mounting pressure. Opening the channel could avert a new refugee wave—35,000 Rohingya fled to Bangladesh between January and December 2024, as per UNHCR. A full-scale famine might push thousands more across the border. However, opposition parties like the BNP argue the channel legitimises Myanmar's junta and the AA. ""Why should Bangladesh clean up Myanmar's mess?"" asked BNP leader Rumeen Farhana. Others fear entanglement in Myanmar's war. In February 2024, a mortar shell from AA-junta clashes landed in Bandarban, injuring two Bangladeshi farmers. The junta vs the AA Myanmar's junta, isolated since its 2021 coup, views Rakhine through a prism of paranoia. It has repeatedly blocked UN aid, fearing it would bolster AA influence. The AA, meanwhile, seeks recognition as Rakhine's de facto authority. For both, the channel is less about saving lives than asserting sovereignty. The Kosovo 2.0 myth or reality? Opposition claims comparing the channel to NATO's 1999 Kosovo intervention are hyperbolic but reflect valid anxieties. Kosovo's precedent, where humanitarian intervention led to state fragmentation, looms large in Dhaka. A more apt parallel is Syria's cross-border aid mechanism from Turkey (2014-2023), which sustained 4.1 million civilians but enabled Turkish influence over opposition zones. For Bangladesh, the lesson is clear: humanitarian access must be insulated from state-building ambitions. A path forward
 Drawing from political scientist Stephen Walt's balance-of-threat theory, Bangladesh should: Demand tripartite oversight: Aid convoys require consent from Myanmar's junta, AA, and ASEAN monitors to prevent politicisation. Secure regional guarantees: India and China must publicly oppose cross-border attacks on Bangladesh. Link aid to accountability: Use the channel to pressure Myanmar into accepting a UN-supervised Rohingya repatriation process. Sovereignty as the red line Bangladesh's dilemma mirrors that of many small states: act as a responsible global citizen while avoiding entanglement in others' conflicts. The channel's success hinges on strict neutrality and multilateral oversight. As international relations scholar Hedley Bull argued, even in an anarchic world, states can cooperate through shared rules, but only if power asymmetries are acknowledged. For Bangladesh, this means prioritising its constitution's mandate: ""The state shall base its international relations on… respect for national sovereignty"" (Article 25). Humanitarian imperatives must not override that principle. Zakir Kibria is a writer and policy analyst. He can be reached at [email protected]. Views expressed in this article are the author's own.

https://www.thedailystar.net//business/news/two-thirds-social-protection-allocations-not-genuine-3898681,Two-thirds of social protection allocations not genuine,https://www.thedailystar.net//business/news/two-thirds-social-protection-allocations-not-genuine-3898681,"Nearly two-thirds of the allocations under this fiscal year's social security budget do not qualify as genuine social protection spending, according to a study by the Citizens Platform for SDGs, Bangladesh. The platform classified the 140 existing social safety net programmes into three categories: acceptable, quasi-acceptable (mainly loan and training schemes), and non-acceptable -- those that should be excluded from the social protection framework. It found that only 29 percent of the allocation is considered ""acceptable"" -- programmes that should naturally be included in the social protection list. Only 4.6 percent is quasi-acceptable, and the rest is not acceptable, the study said. ""Regrettably, the social protection budget has been unrealistically inflated over the years by increasing the share of 'non-acceptable' programmes, which have no relevance to the Leave No One Behind (LNOB) principle,"" said Debapriya Bhattacharya, the platform's convenor. He was addressing a dialogue titled ""Bangladesh Economy 2025-26: Policy Reform and National Budget"" organised by the platform at Lakeshore Hotel in Dhaka yesterday. In FY25, non-acceptable programmes with little relevance to the LNOB policy account for 66.01 percent of the social security budget -- up from 64.49 percent in the revised FY24 budget. From the revised budget for FY24 to FY25, the share of acceptable and quasi-acceptable programmes declined by 3.61 percent and 8 percent respectively, while the share of non-acceptable programmes rose by 2.36 percent, the study noted. In FY25, pension management alone accounts for 96.40 percent of the total allocation under acceptable social protection programmes, it added. Over half of the poor and vulnerable families are not receiving social protection benefits, while 62 percent of non-poor and non-vulnerable households are receiving them, it said, citing the Household Income and Expenditure Survey 2022. This is mainly due to reliance on traditional means of targeting, the lack of an integrated database, corruption associated with the implementation of such programmes, and the absence of a functional grievance redressal system (GRS), said the platform. Bhattacharya suggested raising the allowance for social protection schemes, particularly old-age allowance, allowance for widows and allowance for persons with disabilities. The platform welcomed the government's move to shift the allowance payment method and expand the beneficiary list, as the government plans to add another 10 lakh recipients. ""The decision to shift the allowance payment method and expand the beneficiary list is praiseworthy,"" said Bhattacharya. However, without closing the loopholes, it might lead to the continued exclusion of deserving beneficiaries and perpetuate the same issues as before, he said. He added that the government should exclude non-acceptable programmes, such as pensions, from the SSNP and increase the allowances by adjusting for current inflation. The government should establish a digitalised process for the mapping of the delivery chain for distributing social protection benefits and ensuring transparency. A ""Social Protection Fund"" should be established to support specific and targeted groups as per the LNOB principle. This might help reduce inequalities in service delivery while increasing human capital and reducing poverty in the long run, he said. In the near future, the government might consider integrating social protection with a centralised database to ensure equitable distribution through a transparent system, he suggested. নুসরাত ফারিয়াকে আজ মঙ্গলবার সকালে জামিন দেওয়া হয়।",2025-05-20T00:00:00+06:00
https://www.thedailystar.net//business/news/joblessness-rises-amid-dull-investment-3898676,Joblessness rises amid dull investment,https://www.thedailystar.net//business/news/joblessness-rises-amid-dull-investment-3898676,"Jobs in Bangladesh are not being created in line with the demand from its youth population, leading to a rise in unemployment despite the urgent need for more job opportunities. Bangladesh's unemployment rate increased to 4.63 percent in the October-December period of fiscal year 2024-25 as a growing number of job seekers failed to secure employment, according to the latest Quarterly Labour Force Survey (QLFS) data. The number of unemployed people rose to 2.7 million in 2024, up from 2.55 million the previous year. The jobless rate stood at 3.95 percent in the fourth quarter of 2023, the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (BBS) said yesterday. However, this increased to 4.49 percent in the July-September quarter of FY25 after economic activities ground to a halt following a mass uprising that led to the ouster of the Sheikh Hasina-led government and subsequent labour unrest in major industrial areas of Dhaka. The overall unemployment rate stood at 4.48 percent last year compared to 4.15 percent in 2023. In the October-December quarter of 2024, the labour force participation rate dropped to 48.41 percent from 50.27 percent a year earlier. During the full year, the labour force participation rate was 49.49 percent, compared to 50.92 percent in 2023. Noted economist Rizwanul Islam said the total number of people in the labour force has declined, indicating that potential members of the labour force are feeling discouraged by job prospects and are staying away. The latest QLFS data showed that the labour force participation rate declined in the fourth quarter of 2024 and throughout 2025, mainly due to reduced participation of women in the workforce. ""The number declined more sharply for women, which means that the country is unable to utilise a major part of its human resources. The gender difference and its causes require serious research,"" added Islam, a former special adviser on employment at the International Labour Office in Geneva. ""Rising unemployment is a matter of worry, but it is more worrisome if it is associated with a rise in youth unemployment, which is already much higher than general unemployment."" The country is not only losing out on the possibility of reaping demographic dividends but also seeing a potential source of social discontent and unrest continue, he said. The number employed in industry has continued its downward trend despite healthy growth in exports and output, indicating a continuation of jobless growth. Furthermore, the continued decline in the share of industry shows that the reverse movement of the structure of employment is continuing. From a long-term point of view of development, this is disappointing and worrisome, the economist added. Prof Mustafizur Rahman, a distinguished fellow at the Centre for Policy Dialogue, said job creation depends mainly on private investment, which has stagnated. Amid high inflationary pressure, the central bank is controlling the supply of money to cool off prices, leading to a rise in lending rates. Another major factor hindering investment is political uncertainty. Inflation has remained above 9 percent since March of 2023, standing at 9.17 percent in April this year. Amid the central bank's measures to control the money supply, credit flow to private firms grew by only 7.15 percent in January this year, the lowest since at least 2015, according to data from the Bangladesh Bank. Furthermore, the equity market, which could contribute to creating capital for the private sector, is not vibrant. Another major factor for investment is not only energy prices, but the availability of energy, which the country has been struggling to ensure. Many industrial units have complained in recent years of being able to operate at only a fraction of their capacity due to inadequate gas supply. ""Foreign direct investment is also not rising, so new jobs are not being created. Manpower exports are also not growing at a higher pace,"" Rahman said. ""Until inflation is controlled and political uncertainty subsides, investment may not get a boost."" He added that the recent rise in exports could be explained by higher productivity, which indicates that job creation in the manufacturing sector did not rise. During July to January of the current fiscal year, LC openings for capital machinery fell 33.68 percent to $1 billion, while LC settlements for capital machinery declined 27.33 percent to $1.24 billion, according to central bank data. ""Job creation is not rising as the business environment is not conducive. Additionally, there is a shortage of confidence and banks are also not financing adequately,"" said Humayun Rashid, a former president of the International Business Forum of Bangladesh. The whole business sector is strained after facing challenges such as the Covid-19 pandemic, global supply chain jitters, and geopolitical problems within a couple of years. Moreover, the previous government regime failed to create a proper investment environment. So, job creation is not rising adequately, he said. ""Now, the government is taking some steps towards reform, which should have been taken at least 30 years ago,"" he said, recommending that the government focus on addressing policy issues to ensure a smooth business environment. For instance, registration of land and licensing should be easier for entrepreneurs, he said. ""If one government enacts reforms, what is the guarantee that another government will not change it,"" he questioned, drawing on his previous experiences of frequent policy changes. Moreover, the country's education system should be contemporary and forward looking so that educated people can match industry demands, Rashid added. A vocational education system exists, but qualified manpower is not coming out of the system as teachers are not up to date with modern need-based demands. The education system should be need-based and targeted, he said. নুসরাত ফারিয়াকে আজ মঙ্গলবার সকালে জামিন দেওয়া হয়।",2025-05-20T00:00:00+06:00
https://www.thedailystar.net//business/news/the-post-truce-state-us-china-trade-looks-dire-3898651,The post-truce state of US-China trade looks dire,https://www.thedailystar.net//business/news/the-post-truce-state-us-china-trade-looks-dire-3898651,"Markets appear to be writing off the latest Sino-American trade conflict as quickly as they priced it in. China's benchmark CSI 300 index is up 1.4 percent this year, marking a full recovery from its sharp drop in early April after President Donald Trump announced a 34 percent reciprocal tariff on Chinese goods, which swiftly spiralled into triple-digit retaliatory levies. The latter has been cancelled and the former suspended for 90 days, leaving the official reciprocal charge at 10 percent, level with other countries. In reality, it's much higher. Beijing's burden was already heavier, having started out Trump's second term with effective tariffs of roughly 11 percent incurred during his previous trade war. Almost immediately, the White House then slapped another 20 percent on Chinese goods, citing concerns over fentanyl. That, stacked atop the other blanket levies, brings the country's total to more than 40 percent. The administration did carve out some exemptions for smartphones, computers and other electronics. Factor in both those but also new global tariffs on products like steel, and the effective rate is almost 32 percent, per Fitch. That's far higher than the global average of about 13 percent, the rating agency estimates. Optimists may take heart from the speed with which Beijing and Washington scrapped the retaliatory levies. So far, though, aside from a modest and preliminary pact with the UK, there is little indication that US. discussions with its other trading partners are yielding much real progress ahead of their 90-day deadline in early July. Worse, the electronics carve-out on April 13 was followed the next day by a national security probe into semiconductor imports. If that ends up shrinking the loophole and pushing the effective rate on China higher, it will complicate already fraught trade talks. Those with skin in the game don't expect a quick deal restoring the status quo ante. Apple  intends to shift production of most US-bound iPhones to India, Reuters reported last month. Last week, Allan Wong, CEO of Hong Kong's Vtech — one of the world's largest toymakers and a supplier for Walmart — told the Financial Times that he planned to shift all production for the US market out of China by the end of next year. Other manufacturers previously battered by protracted uncertainty during Trump's 2018-2020 trade war are planning similar moves, Nikkei and others have reported. Traders may be betting on a quick resolution, but that's at odds with the dire situation on the ground. The effective US tariff rate on imports from China currently stands at 31.8 percent, per a report from ratings agency Fitch on May 13, the highest of any trading partner. That's after President Donald Trump's administration on May 12 suspended for 90 days the 34 percent US reciprocal tariff on goods from the People's Republic and cancelled triple-digit retaliatory levies imposed last month. The White House exempted smartphones, computers and some other electronics from reciprocal tariffs on April 13, but opened a national security probe into semiconductor imports the following day. Allan Wong, CEO of Hong Kong-based VTech, one of the world's largest toymakers and supplier for Walmart, told the Financial Times on May 14 that despite the trade truce his company planned to shift all production for the American market out of China by the end of 2026. নুসরাত ফারিয়াকে আজ মঙ্গলবার সকালে জামিন দেওয়া হয়।",2025-05-20T00:00:00+06:00
https://www.thedailystar.net//business/news/fallacies-financial-reporting-bangladesh-3898636,Fallacies in financial reporting in Bangladesh,https://www.thedailystar.net//business/news/fallacies-financial-reporting-bangladesh-3898636,"Credible financial reporting is a matter of public confidence, yet in many cases, it has failed to meet expectations, especially in recent times. Debates and discussions have taken centre stage, with arguments and counterarguments being fervently exchanged. Let us revisit the fundamentals. Financial reporting has gained significance, especially when management, owners, and other stakeholders are distinct entities. To standardise the reporting framework, standards such as International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and International Accounting Standards (IAS) have been adopted alongside country-specific regulations. Besides, the United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (US GAAP) apply to entities within that jurisdiction. This uniform framework is designed for the benefit of investors and stakeholders, especially in the context of cross-border investments. It is worth noting that financial statements, including explanatory notes and auditors' reports where applicable, are very important sources of information upon which financial decisions, such as investment or disinvestment, are based globally. It is a universally accepted practice that management bears primary responsibility for preparing and presenting financial statements and ensuring reliable financial reporting. Auditors, on the other hand, form an independent opinion on the fairness of these financial statements, based on the audit and the management's representations, as outlined in the International Standards on Auditing (ISA). Unfortunately, in instances of financial misreporting, blame is often, and sometimes unjustifiably, directed at auditors. In some cases, regulatory interventions that disregard established financial reporting frameworks and principles have further compounded the problem. This has been observed in banks and non-bank financial institutions (NBFIs) when making provisions for bad and doubtful loans. Similar interventions have been made in mutual funds and merchant banks in dealing with margin loans. The pertinent question now is why the quality and authenticity of financial reporting are being questioned and who is principally accountable. What often goes wrong is an absence of clarity regarding the respective roles of financial statement preparers and auditors. In essence, management is responsible for preparing credible financial statements free from material misstatements and omissions. Auditors, in turn, must provide an opinion on those financial statements, free from material misstatements and gross negligence in the audit process. People often confuse terms like audit, special audit, review, investigation, fraud examination, and forensic audit. However, forming an opinion on the fairness of financial statements is distinct from other verification exercises, each of which has its own objectives, methodologies, and outcomes. Thus, the roles of management and auditors must be clearly defined and understood within the context of financial reporting standards and frameworks. Regulatory bodies must be adequately knowledgeable about the respective roles of preparers and auditors. Users of financial statements should also possess a reasonable level of financial literacy. The involvement of professionals is essential in assessing the quality of financial reporting. In this regard, the Financial Reporting Council (FRC) has a greater role to play in involving the right professionals to oversee and enhance the quality of financial reporting. In Bangladesh, poor financial reporting has, in several instances, deceived stakeholders. Both preparers and auditors should be held accountable for their respective failures. Management should be penalised for material misstatements and omissions, while auditors should be held responsible for material misstatements and gross negligence in the audit process. Until such accountability is enforced, the practice of presenting substandard financial statements will persist, negatively affecting the economy, particularly in terms of revenue collection. While auditing is undoubtedly important, greater emphasis should be placed on the accurate preparation of financial statements. Good corporate governance is also instrumental in ensuring transparency in financial reporting.

Industrial production in the export powerhouse grew 6.1 percent on-year in April, according to figures published by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS). The reading was higher than the 5.7 percent forecast in a Bloomberg survey, but still lower than the 7.7 percent jump recorded for March. ""The national economy withstood pressure and grew steadily in April,"" the NBS said, acknowledging a ""complex situation of increasing external shocks and layered internal difficulties and challenges"". China and the United States last week agreed to slash sweeping tariffs on each other's goods for 90 days, raising hopes the global economy can avoid a major downturn. In addition to heightened trade tensions, Beijing has also been battling a persistent slump in domestic spending, threatening its official growth target for this year of around five percent. Data on Monday showed retail sales, a key gauge of domestic demand, grew 5.1 percent year-on-year last month, short of the 5.8 percent growth forecast by Bloomberg. The reading also marked a slowdown from March's 5.9 percent growth. Meanwhile, China's surveyed unemployment rate edged down slightly to 5.1 percent, from 5.2 percent in March, according to the NBS. ""Economic activities softened only marginally in April as exports stayed resilient despite higher US tariffs,"" Zhiwei Zhang, president and chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management, wrote in a note. ""Now that the tariffs have been cut significantly, I expect exports to remain strong,"" Zhang said, adding that ""economic momentum in the second quarter will likely be stable"". Adding to woes is a years-long downturn in the once-booming property market, which previously represented a key engine for the country's economy. April saw the price of new residential properties contract in 67 out of 70 surveyed cities, reflecting continued consumer caution, according to the data. নুসরাত ফারিয়াকে আজ মঙ্গলবার সকালে জামিন দেওয়া হয়।",2025-05-20T00:00:00+06:00

The hosts chased down a daunting 205-run target to secure their first-ever win over Bangladesh in a high-scoring thriller. UAE held their nerve in a dramatic final over to level the three-match series 1-1. Bangladesh captain Liton Das pointed to the conditions as a major factor behind the loss. ""Any loss is hard, but we still batted well on this wicket. Wicket was pretty good, when they batted, they had the favour of dew,"" said Liton at the post-match presentation. ""We missed a bit in the fielding and in the middle-overs bowling. When you play on this type of ground, which is small and with dew a factor, you have to calculate and plan (as bowlers)."" He also admitted his own performance and that of key bowlers needed improvement. ""What Rana did before (his final over), we were expecting more from him. You can have good days and bad days. We will sit and talk and come back. (On his innings) What I did is not up to the mark but I will try my best."" The match turned when UAE captain Muhammad Waseem took center stage with a blistering 82 off just 42 balls, laced with nine fours and five sixes. His knock laid the platform, but his dismissal with 58 runs still required could have swung momentum back to Bangladesh. Instead, UAE's lower order showed composure and resilience. From No. 7 downwards, every UAE batter cleared the ropes at least once, with Dhruv Parashar holding his nerve in the tense final over. The decisive moment came when Haider Ali struck a free hit for the winning runs off Tanzim Hasan on the penultimate ball. A misfield and a delayed throw from Towhid Hridoy allowed Haider and Matiullah Khan to complete the match-sealing two runs. ""I have no words. I am very happy we beat Bangladesh. Very happy with the performance,"" said a jubilant Waseem, who was named player of the match. ""I was giving hope to everyone that we can chase this score because we know the conditions (here)."" Looking ahead to the decider, Waseem was optimistic: ""We will go with our strength (in the third game) and hopefully we can make it 2-1."" The result sets up an exciting finale, with UAE eyeing a historic series win and Bangladesh desperate for redemption tomorrow at the same venue.

Cristiano Ronaldo, long seen as the Argentine's main rival, notably fell outside the top three. Founded in Leipzig, Germany in 1984, the IFFHS is globally recognized for chronicling football's rich history and data. Their latest rankings were published after a detailed selection process combining expert opinions and fan input from around the world.) The IFFHS explained their methodology: ""The final rankings are based on a hybrid model of 100 registered offline expert votes (weighted at 25%) and online voting (weighted at 75%), which included inputs from fans and media organisations worldwide."" This approach aimed to balance historical perspective with contemporary influence. Messi, who recently captured his record eighth Ballon d'Or, reflected on his storied rivalry with Ronaldo in an interview with L'Equipe: ""It was a great battle, from a sporting point of view.

The win sees UAE level the T20I series 1-1 with the third match to be played on May 21 at the same venue. Haider Ali, playing just his second T20I, held his nerve in a final over bowled by Tanzim Sakib to take UAE over the ropes. The left-hander was the only recognized batter left when he hit a six off Shoriful Islam over deep point to keep UAE in the game. Shoriful conceded an overthrow boundary in last delivery of 19th over to ensure they need 12 off the last over. More drama was left for the last over. Sakib started his final over with a wide and was then hit for six by Dhruv Parashar. With four needed off four deliveries, Sakib's slower found the mark, castling Parashar. Comedy of errors ensued when UAE, needing 3 off two deliveries found a lifeline as Sakib bowled a high full toss which was called a no-ball. The penultimate ball of the innings was hit over point by Haider and amidst the confusion between the batters, an even more confused Tawhid Hridoy did not throw the ball at first opportunity as the batters completed two runs to take UAE over the ropes. UAE skipper Muhammad Waseem lit up the Sharjah stadium with glittering strokeplay, taking a particular liking to debutant Nahid Rana. The UAE openers matched Bangladesh opening pair's flair, scoring 68 in the Powerplay. The opening pair produced a 107-run partnership before Tanvir Islam managed to break the stand. Waseem ensured that Rana went for 32 in his first two overs as the youngster failed to keep his line and length. Waseem blitzed a 42-ball 82 and with UAE looking good for a win, Shoriful managed his scalp to cause a slump. UAE slumped from 148 for 2 to 177 for six in the space of 17 deliveries before the chaotic final few overs saw them hold their nerve for a momentous win. Earlier after being sent to bat, Tanzid Tamim led the way with a 25-ball 50 for Bangladesh while Liton Das held up one end at the top before contributions from Tawhid Hridoy and Jaker Ali saw Bangladesh post Bangladesh made four changes to the lineup as Najumul Hossain Shanto came in for injured Parvez Hossain Emon and Rishad Hossain, Shoriful Islam and Nahid Rana replaced Sheikh Mahedi, Hasan Mahmud and Mustafizur Rahman. Tanzid Tamim made the most of his second opportunity this series as Bangladesh notched 66 runs without loss in the Powerplay. The left-hander failed to connect properly and was holed out at backward square-leg for 58 off 31 deliveries in the 10th over which saw the opening stand between Liton and Tanzid end at 90 runs. Tigers reached 100-run mark with Shanto getting off the blocks quickly however UAE stemmed the flow of runs with Liton falling for 40 off 32 deliveries. Shanto, having started brightly, struggled with his timing late on as he departed for 27 off 19. Towhid Hridoy meanwhile had provided the boost to the innings with a 24-ball 45 while Jaker Ali struck 18 off 6 as Tigers reached 205 for 5. নুসরাত ফারিয়াকে আজ মঙ্গলবার সকালে জামিন দেওয়া হয়।",2025-05-19T22:58:48+06:00

Ancelotti was named Brazil's first permanent foreign coach last week and will start in his new role on May 26 on a contract that runs through to next year's World Cup finals. The five-times Champions League winning coach will lead the country into June's South American qualifiers, and 2018 World Cup winner Varane believes Ancelotti has the pedigree to reinvigorate the squad following recent struggles. ""What I can say is that in football, in national teams, it's about being at the top level with a very short period of time to prepare yourself to perform,"" Varane told Reuters on the sidelines of the Hong Kong Soccer Sevens. ""So it's a different challenge that you're facing from the day-to-day with a club. ""But I think if you're capable of winning trophies like the Champions League, and if you're capable of raising your level for big games, then you're capable of doing it anywhere, at any time. ""I think Carlo is a great coach. He has a lot of experience, so he knows how to prepare the players to perform at the right time. ""That's the difficult thing. You have to meet with history. Every time (at the World Cup) it's only one chance, so you can't miss many opportunities. I think at the top level he knows how to do it."" The former defender knows Ancelotti well after they shared two seasons at Real Madrid in the Italian's first spell in charge and together they won the Champions League in 2014, one of four continental crowns Varane collected at the Bernabeu. Brazil are currently fourth in the standings in the South American preliminaries, 10 points adrift of bitter rivals Argentina, who have already secured their berth at next year's tournament in the United States, Canada and Mexico. While the Brazilians remain likely to qualify despite their faltering form, Varane was confident Ancelotti could raise standards to ensure the team are competitive at the finals. ""If he goes there, he knows how to do it, how to prepare the players, feeling comfortable and confident enough because we are talking about Brazil,"" said Varane. ""At that level the players have the quality, they just need to be together and confident."" নুসরাত ফারিয়াকে আজ মঙ্গলবার সকালে জামিন দেওয়া হয়।",2025-05-20T00:27:24+06:00

Chasing 206 for victory, Abhishek set up the chase with his blitz laced with four fours and six sixes as Hyderabad achieved the target with 10 balls to spare in Lucknow. Abhishek departed in the eighth over before Heinrich Klaasen, who hit 47, and Kamindu Mendis, who retired hurt on 32, guided the team to the brink of victory with their fourth-wicket partnership of 55. Lucknow became the fifth team to bow out of the play-off contention leaving five-time champions Mumbai Indians and Delhi Capitals to battle for one remaining spot. Gujarat Titans, Punjab Kings and Royal Challengers Bengaluru are already through to the playoffs starting May 29. The left-handed Abhishek took on the attack after he lost his opening partner Atharva Taide, who became New Zealand quick Will O'Rourke's first wicket on his IPL debut. Abhishek hit five sixes, including three in succession off Ravi Bishnoi, to reach his fifty in 18 balls and followed it up with another hit over the fence. Leg-spinner Digvesh Rathi cut short Abhishek's knock and Hyderabad lost another left-hander Ishan Kishan on 35 before South Africa's Klaasen and Sri Lankan left-hander Mendis controlled the chase. Shardul Thakur denied Klaasen his fifty and Mendis hobbled off with a foot injury before Nitish Reddy and Aniket Verma sealed the win. Earlier Mitchell Marsh and Aiden Markram laid the foundations for Lucknow's 205-7 in their opening stand of 115. Marsh top-scored with 65 in a knock laced with six fours and four sixes and Markram hit 61 before Nicholas Pooran contributed with his 26-ball 45 to boost the total. The rest of the batters failed to get into double figures including another flop for skipper Rishabh Pant, who fell caught and bowled for seven off Sri Lanka seam bowler Eshan Malinga. Wicketkeeper-batsman Pant has failed to fire since Lucknow splashed a record $3.21 million on him at the November auction, scoring just 135 runs from 11 innings this IPL season. Malinga stood out with figures of 2-28 in his four overs. Pooran missed out on his fifty in an attempt to steal a single in the 20th over which witnessed two run outs and another wicket. The IPL is into its final phase and restarted Saturday after it was paused due to a conflict between India and Pakistan. Since the pause in the IPL, the tournament has been rescheduled with the final now set to take place on June 3. নুসরাত ফারিয়াকে আজ মঙ্গলবার সকালে জামিন দেওয়া হয়।",2025-05-20T00:35:01+06:00

The agreement comes nearly three months after BFF appointed local brand Dour as the national team's kit partner. This marks the first time BFF has formalised such a deal, with BFF vice president Fahad Karim and Takashi Ozaki, leader of the Molten Asian Group, signing the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on behalf of their respective organisations at the BFF House. Under the deal, Bangladesh will purchase 2,000 Molten footballs annually at a discounted rate. Molten will also provide an additional 2,000 footballs free of charge each year. In recent years, BFF have already been using Molten footballs across various competitions, purchasing 3,130 footballs last year alone. ""I'm very happy because I had a lot of discussions with Fahad and finally, I am here to support Bangladesh Football Federation so that they can strengthen the national football team,"" Ozaki told reporters at the BFF House. BFF vice president Fahad noted that BFF usually purchases footballs for competitions using funds from the Asian Football Confederation (AFC), and the new agreement with Molten will save them Tk 50 lakh annually. ""We, the executive committee, are very committed to a few things. First of all, efficient financial management; second, bringing more sponsorships, which are much needed; and thirdly, enhancing the brand value of Bangladesh football,"" said Fahad, adding that they have had kit sponsors of the national football teams. ""Before we came to sign the MoU, we spent a lot on equipment, especially footballs, every year, and we procured 3,130 Molten footballs last year at a cost of Tk 1.30 crore,"" said Fahad, adding that they would now save Tk 50 lakh, which will be spent on buying other equipment in line with suggestions from the technical and national teams committees. নুসরাত ফারিয়াকে আজ মঙ্গলবার সকালে জামিন দেওয়া হয়।",2025-05-19T20:45:36+06:00

https://www.thedailystar.net//my-dhaka/news/shambhu-acharyas-solo-exhibition-art-carries-years-legacy-3896251,Shambhu acharya’s solo exhibition: Art that carries years of legacy,https://www.thedailystar.net//my-dhaka/news/shambhu-acharyas-solo-exhibition-art-carries-years-legacy-3896251,"Though the first thing you notice right after entering might be the colours, since they are vibrant, generous, full of life, but there is something more, the scent of something older might carry you away. Not incense, not paint, but time. Time cooked down into lines and pigment, and tradition passed through generations. At Galleri Kaya, the solo exhibition of Shambhu Acharya, a name well known in the world of patachitra, surrounds you with artworks that seem to make you forget you're standing in a contemporary space and not a room pulled out of Bengal's own memory. Patachitra, literally meaning ""cloth painting"", is a traditional art form rooted in folklore, mythology, and rural life. While many artists practice the form today, what makes Acharya's work feel different is not just the technique but the reverence. Even calling him an artist feels slightly off, it's like calling a monk a craftsman. The process, for him, seems almost like prayer, and that devotion translates into the emotion and storytelling of each work. It's in the way the colours are made from scratch, pigments ground from brick, seeds, stone, sometimes even riverbed soil. The thickening agent? Extracted from tamarind seeds. The brushes? Made of goat's hair. ""Some strokes in these paintings are not possible without these special brushes,"" Acharya said simply. Among the vibrant narratives of patachitra, a quieter form of storytelling stood apart, kushthichitra, the artist shifts into monochrome, abandoning the vivid palette for earthier, ink-based minimal tones.One visitor said, ""The reason why I like patachitra is these are done using a technique which is our very own traditional technique, using all natural and handmade colours. Another intriguing thing about this exhibition waskushthichitra, I have never seen these artworks before."" Drawn at the time of a child's birth, especially in Hindu families, a kushthi records more than just name and lineage. It maps the planets, stars, and celestial alignments at the moment of arrival, a visual document of fate.""Just like we keep records of land or property, a kushthi is the document of a person's life,"" said Acharya. ""It tells the story from birth to midlife to death, following the astrology we've had for generations."" If the newborn is a girl, she appears in the painting; if a boy, then he. The kushthi scroll, though visually simpler than the patachitra, carries a quiet weight, attempting to tell a life before it even unfolds. Acharya belongs to a legacy more than 450 years old, making him the ninth generation in a family of traditional artists. He didn't so much choose this path as he was born into it, long before he even learned to write the alphabets. As a child, he would drag leaves across walls and scratch bricks onto floors just to see the trace they left. The fascination with colour, its possibility and presence was always there. That same respect for process runs through the entire exhibition, each on display paints vivid scenes from folklores, mythology and rural life, bride carried on a boat, women fetching water from river, two friends braiding each other's hair, a flute player casting a glance toward a woman and many more. One of the visitors, Abdullah Bin Amir summed it up, ""I really liked the idea about doing artworks on our folktales. It's rare to see. I personally like folklore and tales, and how the artist represented mythical characters in a traditional form, it was more than amazing. Not modernised, not abstract, just raw and true to the tradition"". These days when art is often rushed, mordenised and soaked in factory made colours, Acharya's work stands a part with his honesty, devotion and tradition it carries. Both his son and daughter are picking it up slowly, the strokes, the stories, the little rituals that shaped him. And maybe that's what stays with you the most, not just that this art has lasted nine generations, but that it's still alive, still breathing, and still being passed gently, hand to hand. নুসরাত ফারিয়াকে আজ মঙ্গলবার সকালে জামিন দেওয়া হয়।",2025-05-17T00:45:21+06:00
https://www.thedailystar.net//my-dhaka/news/why-everyones-quietly-moving-uttara-3895526,Why everyone’s quietly moving to Uttara,https://www.thedailystar.net//my-dhaka/news/why-everyones-quietly-moving-uttara-3895526,"""Uttara is so far away. Oh God, Uttara traffic! Uttara is a gram (village)!"" These are the things I have to constantly hear and bear because I live in this ""far-off land"" called Uttara. In my imagination, Uttara is like Malificent's garden. A magical forest realm bordering a human kingdom, Uttara is considered a model town within the broader Dhaka metropolitan city. To the naysayers, know that this planned neighbourhood is one of the divisions within the Dhaka Metropolitan Police, and it is greener and more tranquil than many of the posh urban core areas or city centres. Living in this beautiful suburb in the northern part of Dhaka has both pros and cons, and I agree with that. The distance does pose a problem for many, but it is only 22 km away from the zero point. It is not that far, if you compare it with the time it takes to travel to other outskirts and neighbourhoods adjoining the capital. The traffic bottlenecks in Uttara are a result of jams on the Tongi-Gazipur highway or on Mymensingh road; otherwise, there are only a few signals inside this well-organised residential area that hamper the flow of traffic. In my two decades of living here, I can say that Uttara has become a thriving hub of economic, social, and cultural activities, which was not the case a few years ago. Thoroughfares and avenues like Rabindra Sarani, Jashimuddin Avenue, Sonargaon Janapath, Gareeb-e-Nawaz Avenue and Gausul Azam Avenue, which were lacklustre when I came to live here, are now booming with restaurants, cafes, rooftop eateries, shopping malls, hotels and offices. With most of the happening cafes opening their branches in Uttara, the after-office hours, evenings, and weekends have become a routine social activity filled with fun, adding to Uttara's vibrant nightlife. North End Coffee Roasters at Liberty Tower, which is a 13-story posh commercial building located beside the Dhaka-Mymensingh highway in Uttara; Gloria Jeans in Navana Centroid, another modern architectural infrastructure in Gareeb-e-Newaz Avenue; KOI Thé Bangladesh, a fancy bubble/boba tea store in Sonargaon Janapath; are all favourite spots for families and young adults. Besides regular restaurants, Uttara flaunts two unique options for eating outside -- Yama Hotpot and Grill in Gausul Azam Avenue, which is probably the first of its kind in Dhaka; and Huaxing Chinese Food, which is a hole-in-the-wall kind of authentic Chinese eatery. They do not have fancy or modern ambiance, but they are popular for their authentic flavours and affordable prices. The warm ambiance of green rooftop cafes, offering a panoramic view of the open fields -- and with their diverse culinary menu, has all added a fun factor to Uttara's soul. Besides eating out, thrift shopping in Uttara is an added plus point. The street behind Rajlaxmi Complex, the underground markets, and footpath markets have given a new meaning to cheap street shopping. Uttara residents are crazy for the various van markets selling unusual ceramic crockery, bed sheets, curtains, clothing, costume jewellery, etc. Urban villages on the outskirts of Uttara make its farmers' market one of the best in town. Villagers sell an array of homegrown vegetables and leafy greens with an organic tag. The colours and tempo of this laid-back but contemporary and versatile residential area give you a calm yet energetic vibe. Uttara is set to become the next commercial and social hub of Dhaka because of its prime location near the MRT and elevated expressway. This emerging satellite town is a shade of all the fun colours -- yellow, green, blue, black, and pink. And wait till Uttara Third Phase develops, you will all want to get a piece of this coming-of-age suburban area. নুসরাত ফারিয়াকে আজ মঙ্গলবার সকালে জামিন দেওয়া হয়।",2025-05-15T21:11:24+06:00

Faria was detained at Dhaka's Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport on Sunday, May 18, while attempting to travel to Thailand, and was later sent to prison following a court order on Monday, May 19. Filmmaker and Cultural Affairs Adviser Mostofa Sarwar Farooki addressed Nusrat Faria's arrest as ""awkward and concerning,"" urging greater sensitivity in handling such cases. He reaffirmed the government's stance against blanket arrests without prior investigation and questioned the timing of her detention amid political tensions. ""Our primary task is to bring the actual offenders of the July incident to justice,"" he stated. Actress Azmeri Haque Badhan condemned the arrest, calling it ""unacceptable"" and a reflection of a system where ""basic rights"" are no longer upheld. Television actor Khairul Basar questioned the logic behind punishing an artiste for performing a scripted role in a government-commissioned film. ""She hasn't even been politically active. Then why is she being harassed?"" he wrote. Filmmaker Shihab Shaheen labelled the case ""absurd"" and ""harassment,"" responding to a commenter who accused Faria of siding with a tyrannical regime. ""She acted in a film. Does that make her an accomplice?"" he asked. Rapper Mahmud Hasan Tabib recalled Faria's now-viral quote while promoting ""Mujib"", ""There's a Hasina in every girl,"" and questioned the fairness of labelling her a criminal for it. Director Ashfaque Nipun criticised the practice of targeting ""soft figures"" like artistes while real offenders evade justice. He called the charges against Faria, who was abroad during the alleged incident, a troubling misuse of the legal system. Actors Equity also released a statement condemning the arrests and lawsuits against artistes.  ""Artistes have always been vocal and conscious in serving and safeguarding the interests of society and the state. Not only that, their role in any humanitarian need is also undeniable. Therefore, we believe that protecting the interests and dignity of these artistes is a moral responsibility of society and the state. Harassing arrests, lawsuits, and attacks against artistes create concern and anxiety, disrupting the normal lives of the artists and their families and leaving them helpless. Such incidents also lead to various forms of disorder in social life. Hence, the ongoing organised attempts to tarnish the image of the artistic community must come to an end. In this regard, we expect the government to take fair and non-discriminatory actions. We always remain respectful toward justice."" Collectively, their statements call into question the boundaries between artistic expression and political persecution. নুসরাত ফারিয়াকে আজ মঙ্গলবার সকালে জামিন দেওয়া হয়।",2025-05-19T18:30:34+06:00

Since 2017, Kidman has made good on her promise to work with a woman filmmaker every 18 months—an initiative she has surpassed by collaborating with 27 women directors over the past eight years. At the awards event, the 57-year-old actor reflected on the pledge she made and the risks involved in changing the industry from within.
""I had to say, 'This is how I'm doing it. We'll take the risk. We're going to mentor, support, help and protect,'"" Kidman shared. ""The only way to do it is to actually show up and say, 'I'm here. I'll be in your film.'"" She also recalled moments where the lack of representation became impossible to ignore. ""We were at a point where there was such a disparity in terms of choice, you'd wonder, 'Could a woman direct this?'"" she said. In addition to spotlighting the need for gender parity, Kidman addressed another pressing issue in the industry: ageism.
""You get to a certain age, maybe you've made a great film in your 20s that got celebrated, and then in your 40s, you haven't followed it up, or your choices didn't pan out. But you're still here, saying, 'I'm not over. Please still believe in me, invest in me."" Emphasising that talent doesn't expire, she added, ""It's vital to resist ageism. There are emerging talents, yes—but also those with years of experience who've been unfairly cast aside. We need to say, 'You can have a second or even third chapter.'"" Brazilian filmmaker Marianna Brennand also received the Women in Motion Emerging Talent award at Cannes. Both she and Kidman posed for photographers after the ceremony, celebrating two generations of women changing the face of cinema. On the work front, Kidman was last seen in Holland and is set to return in ""Nine Perfect Strangers"" Season 2. নুসরাত ফারিয়াকে আজ মঙ্গলবার সকালে জামিন দেওয়া হয়।",2025-05-19T15:42:37+06:00

Following the arrest, Cultural affairs adviser Mostofa Sarwar Farooki addressed the issue in a Facebook post.  In his post, Farooki expressed concern over the arrest and questioned the authorities' handling of the situation. 
 ""I generally try not to speak beyond the responsibilities of my ministry. But I do have an identity—I was a part of this industry and will be returning to it. The arrest of Nusraat Faria has become an awkward incident for us,"" said Farooki. ""It is the responsibility of our government to bring actual offenders from the July case to justice. When it comes to blanket cases, our stance is clear: no one will be arrested without a preliminary investigation indicating involvement. And that policy was being followed,"" he added. Farooki noted that although a case had existed against Faria for some time, there had been no apparent move by the government to arrest her prior to the conclusion of the investigation. ""But the incident occurred right after she arrived at the airport,"" he remarked.  He also drew connections between the timing of the arrest and recent political tensions, particularly public reaction to former Awami League president Abdul Hamid's travel abroad. ""Perhaps this incident resulted from over-nervousness or frustration. A few days ago, a similar incident happened with the wife of Barrister Andaleeve Partha. Such incidents are in no way justifiable,"" he said. Farooki expressed hope that Faria would receive appropriate legal recourse. He concluded his statement by urging more sensitivity in handling sweeping legal cases. ""And we hope to be able to handle such blanket cases with greater sensitivity. We must remember that our primary task is to bring the actual offenders of the July incident to justice,"" he wrote. A Dhaka court today sent Nusraat Faria to jail in connection with an attempted murder case linked to the July uprising. নুসরাত ফারিয়াকে আজ মঙ্গলবার সকালে জামিন দেওয়া হয়।",2025-05-19T12:06:46+06:00

Organised by the International Labour Organization (ILO) in partnership with the Bangladesh Institute of Labour Studies (BILS), the exhibition aims to shed light on the vital yet often overlooked world of childcare services in Bangladesh, especially in the context of a growing female workforce. As more women join the country's labor force, the demand for accessible and reliable childcare is rapidly increasing. The exhibition explores the diversity of childcare models currently in practice, ranging from formal centers to informal community-based setups, and presents powerful visuals of childcare workers and the families they support. Through Hasan's lens, the exhibition captures the everyday realities of childcare providers: their dedication, challenges, and the working conditions that often lack standardisation in terms of hours, pay, safety, and access to social protections. The images also highlight the role childcare plays in enabling working parents, particularly mothers, to pursue employment while ensuring their children receive adequate care. Organisers hope the exhibition will initiate conversations about the professionalisation of childcare work and emphasise the need for fair labor conditions in this essential sector. The exhibition is free and open to the public. Visitors are encouraged to attend and engage with the narratives of those who are helping to shape a more inclusive and equitable workforce in Bangladesh. নুসরাত ফারিয়াকে আজ মঙ্গলবার সকালে জামিন দেওয়া হয়।",2025-05-18T21:08:41+06:00

Pascal, known for his outspoken nature, responded to a question on political filmmaking by highlighting the urgency of storytelling in the face of fear-driven politics.  Referencing the climate under Trump's presidency, he said, ""Fear is the way they win. So, keep telling the stories. Keep expressing yourself and keep fighting to be who you are. Defy the people who try to make you scared… And fight back. This is the perfect way to do so in telling stories. And don't let them win."" Although he admitted feeling daunted by the gravity of the subject, saying, ""It's far too intimidating a question for me to really address, I'm not informed enough,"" Pascal's comments rang with personal truth. He then reflected on his family's past, one marked by political exile and survival. ""I want people to be safe and to be protected, and I want very much to live on the right [side of] history,"" he said.  ""I'm an immigrant. My parents are refugees from Chile. We fled a dictatorship, and I was privileged enough to grow up in the US after asylum in Denmark. If it weren't for that, I don't know what would have happened to us. I stand by those protections. I'm too afraid of your question. I hardly remember what it was."" Pascal's remarks come at a time when immigration is once again a heated political flashpoint in the US. This week, the Department of Homeland Security announced a new measure that would pay undocumented migrants $1,000 and offer them travel assistance to voluntarily return to their countries. The initiative is part of a broader crackdown reinstated by Trump during his second term, which includes stricter border enforcement and a slate of executive orders focused on detaining and deporting undocumented immigrants. With ""Eddington"" itself reportedly tackling themes of isolation and absurdity during the pandemic era, Pascal's remarks blurred the line between the political and the personal, reminding audiences that storytelling is often the first act of resistance. নুসরাত ফারিয়াকে আজ মঙ্গলবার সকালে জামিন দেওয়া হয়।",2025-05-18T17:31:03+06:00
https://www.thedailystar.net//life-living/fashion-beauty/news/comfort-the-new-standard-2025-fashion-3898196,Comfort is the new standard in 2025 fashion,https://www.thedailystar.net//life-living/fashion-beauty/news/comfort-the-new-standard-2025-fashion-3898196,"In 2025, you do not need to sacrifice comfort to look fashionable, because comfort has become a major focus in the fashion industry. Loose bottoms, roomy shirts and tops, relaxed dresses are now highly sought after. To our relief, the relaxed look is back in style! Body-hugging garments, be it pants, shirts, kurtis, or salwar kameezes, have given way to comfortable, airy attire made from breathable fabrics, leaving many women, including myself, feeling liberated. The cyclical nature of fashion has brought back the '90s and Y2K styles, and people of all ages are embracing this new trend. Another important factor that contributed to this resurgence is the COVID-19 pandemic, which introduced never-seen-before work models to the world. Remote work or hybrid work models have transformed the way people dress. Wearing casual attire in physical workplaces, which is becoming more and more acceptable, has also led to the resurgence of the relaxed style! Linen or cotton pants, cotton shirts, flared jeans, colourful kaftans, kurtis and co-ord sets are à la mode in 2025. Women are increasingly choosing lighter fabrics, clean lines, and minimal embroidery over synthetic fabrics, heavy embroidery, and form-fitting garments. To the delight of many women, skinny jeans are finally no longer in fashion. I always found the restricting style and cut of skinny jeans extremely uncomfortable, and so glad that they have fallen out of style, hoping that they do not make a comeback soon. The resurgence of relaxed style is also influencing women's haircuts and makeup choices. Because the idea is to appear effortlessly fashionable, women are choosing easy-to-maintain haircuts like blunt cuts, layers, and long bobs. In the world of cosmetics, bold eye makeup, which does not complement the relaxed style, has taken a backseat. Brown and copper eyeshadows, neutral lip colours, and soft, natural-looking blushes in shades of pink, coral, and terracotta are popular. The new idea is to use minimal makeup, just enough to enhance your natural skin, which means that having healthy skin is the most important step to looking polished and beautiful. In 2025, we would like to show off our skin. Therefore, we need to take care of our skin by eating and sleeping well, exercising regularly, staying hydrated, and creating a solid regimen. As we are embracing the retro style, we need to think about shoes that befit relaxed clothes. Slides, especially leather ones, are immensely popular right now and perfectly complement relaxed styles. In addition to slides, wedges, jelly sandals, ballet shoes, and pump shoes featuring pointed tips are also trending in the world of footwear. As the relaxed style is all about comfort, choose classic, minimal jewellery pieces that are suitable for everyday wear. These include gold studs, gold hoops, a chain with pendant, and stacking bracelets. If you want to make a statement, consider a cuff bracelet. Pearls are timeless; their enduring appeal makes them extremely versatile. A pair of pearl studs and/or a pearl necklace will elevate your relaxed look with a touch of elegance. The cycle of fashion has brought back the retro style, where comfort is the focal point. In the post-pandemic world, where numerous aspects of our lives have changed significantly, it looks like the relaxed fashion trend has arrived to stay.   নুসরাত ফারিয়াকে আজ মঙ্গলবার সকালে জামিন দেওয়া হয়।",2025-05-19T15:15:54+06:00
https://www.thedailystar.net//life-living/news/brac-bank-tara-reframes-the-conversation-parenting-shared-journey-partnership-3898231,BRAC Bank TARA reframes the conversation on parenting: A shared journey of partnership,https://www.thedailystar.net//life-living/news/brac-bank-tara-reframes-the-conversation-parenting-shared-journey-partnership-3898231,"On the occasion of International Mother's Day, BRAC Bank's women-centred initiative TARA held an event that did not just celebrate motherhood or struggles of being a mother but gently pulled apart the structure surrounding it. The event titled ""Parenting: A Shared Journey of Partnership"" created space for a much-needed dialogue that was not about glorifying sacrifice but rather about asking why parenting still leans heavily, and often unfairly, on mothers and how partners can show up to share it. Parenting does not come with a rulebook, but it shapes everything from how a child sees the world, how a family survives or breaks, or how a society grows. Yet, in most conversations about it, one parent, usually the mother, carries the weight — both spoken and unspoken. Addressing this imbalance, and supported by the Gates Foundation, the gathering brought together professionals, mothers, fathers, corporate leaders, therapists, and customers of TARA to talk, reflect, and participate. ""When we were planning a Mother's Day programme, we realised how often we focus on the struggles mothers face,"" said Tawhida Shiropa, founder of ""Moner Bondhu"" and one of the key organisers. ""But, we almost never ask, what is the role of a partner in this? That's the question we wanted to bring into the room today in the presence of both parents."" After the opening remarks, the session led by Shiropa and lead psychosocial counsellor Kazi Rumana Haque moved quickly into personal territory. Participants were guided through a breathing exercise. Conversations followed around stress, post-partum depression, parenting styles, and the very idea of what it means to raise a child, not just care for one. In a room full of people who have been navigating sleepless nights, emotional labour, endless decision-making and unspoken guilt, a kind of ease settled in when they opened up, the kind that only comes when you realise you are not alone. ""This session was really helpful,"" said Lopa Mustafa, a TARA customer. ""It broke down the issues in parenting that we thought were normal or right. These kinds of workshops should happen more often. If the conversations keep happening, maybe the practices will follow."" One young mother shared, ""As I'm a new mother, I'm learning every day. Every child is different, so there is not one answer that fits all. But understanding your child and having a supportive partner or family makes all the difference."" A performance choreographed by Arthy Ahmed Dance Academy featuring working mothers who took the time out of their busy schedules to pursue their passion for dancing, was part dance, part diary, full of the tenderness, affection and exhaustion that rarely get seen. The panel discussion that followed brought more texture to the theme. Experts from education, entrepreneurship, and corporate spaces discussed what it means to parent while also navigating jobs, leadership roles, deadlines, and the emotional weight of it all. The discussion touched on co-parenting, emotional labour, and the urgent need for structural changes, like better maternity leave policies and flexible work hours that do not hamper caregiving. Kashef Rahman, founder of ShareTrip, one of the panellists, put it simply: ""No matter how much involvement the father has, according to the society, the main dependency is on the mother, at least till a certain age. So, expectations are more from her than from me. But that does not mean she's solely responsible. It's about understanding. It's about building a partnership that grows naturally. And if it doesn't, then you build it consciously."" The conversations we have grown up with rarely included the word partnership when it came to parenting. A mother gives, a father provides, and somewhere in the middle, an entire family system quietly leans too hard on one side until something gives out. There were many small takeaways instead of grand solutions, like — breathe before you break, ask for help, listen more, share more. And above all, know that parenting is not meant to be carried alone. At least the conversation has begun. Maybe that's where the shift starts. The event took place on 17 May, 2025. নুসরাত ফারিয়াকে আজ মঙ্গলবার সকালে জামিন দেওয়া হয়।",2025-05-19T16:05:45+06:00
https://www.thedailystar.net//life-living/news/zurhem-styles-international-celebrities-the-2025-cannes-film-festival-3898181,Zurhem styles international celebrities at the 2025 Cannes Film Festival,https://www.thedailystar.net//life-living/news/zurhem-styles-international-celebrities-the-2025-cannes-film-festival-3898181,"The red carpets of the 2025 Cannes Film Festival shimmered with glamour, but one name emerged repeatedly among the style standouts — Zurhem. The Bangladeshi fashion house, known for its unapologetic boldness and artisanal precision, made a defining statement this year, as a host of international celebrities chose to wear looks from its Fall/Winter 2025 collection, Solaris. Originally unveiled in Paris during Paris Fashion Week in March, Solaris was an ode to light, celestial geometry, and architectural silhouettes — a collection rooted in optimism and radiant energy. The result; a powerful series of looks that translated seamlessly from the runway to the world's most prestigious red carpet. French actor, model, and influencer Sufian Saï set the tone early, donning Zurhem's striking gold corduroy suit — a structured yet exuberant look that embodied the vibrant essence of Solaris. Global media outlet Brut captured the radiant Vaea Brazier, French social media personality and entrepreneur, in one of the collection's most iconic gowns: a pristine white piece with dramatic sunburst cutouts. Originally showcased in Paris, the gown's sculptural lines and confident minimalism created a red-carpet moment to remember. Ophély Mézino, Miss France 2019 and first runner-up at Miss World 2019, made a bold appearance at the Ray-Ban x Meta Afterparty in an oversized Zurhem trench coat outlined entirely in chunky pearls. Originally styled on a male model during the Paris presentation, the piece was reimagined on Mézino with striking poise and elegance — a nod to Zurhem's fluid approach to gender and silhouette. Also spotted at Cannes was actor, TV host, and founder of Paris Me Chama, Paula Rita Saady, who wore an intricately embroidered green bralette paired with a black circular cutout skirt — a daring yet polished ensemble that embodied the duality of power and delicacy found throughout the Solaris collection. Entrepreneur Sandra Zouma, CEO of KZ24 Limited, and wife of famous French footballer Kurt Zouma, brought her own brand of sophistication to the red carpet in Zurhem's green velvet circular top adorned with sunburst embellishments — an exuberant yet elegant statement piece. Meanwhile, French fashion model Warren CS wore a green Rajshahi Dupion silk look with shimmering gold sunbursts — another key runway piece reinterpreted for the red carpet. And TikTok sensation Yeney, known for her bold digital persona, wore one of Solaris' signature opening look; an off-white cropped blazer lavishly embroidered with pearls. Zurhem's creative momentum at Cannes show no signs of slowing down. The brand is set to dress even more international and French celebrities in the final days of the festival. A particularly anticipated moment is the red-carpet debut of Al Amin, the Bangladeshi internet sensation known for singing in dual voices, and now the lead in Adnan Al Rajeev's short film Ali, one of 11 entries in the Official Competition category at Cannes this year. For Al Amin, Zurhem has designed a custom ensemble inspired by the Shapla Phool (water lily) — Bangladesh's national flower and a central motif in the film — bringing a powerful cultural statement to the global stage. Zurhem's presence in France — from a well-received runway show in Paris to this widespread visibility at Cannes — marks a significant milestone for a brand that continues to challenge conventions and redefine luxury from a South Asian lens. What makes this achievement even more remarkable is that it comes from a homegrown Bangladeshi label, proudly rooted in the country's heritage of craft and storytelling. In a world where fashion capitals have long been gate-kept by legacy European brands, Zurhem's moment at Cannes signals a refreshing shift. It represents the rise of South Asian design voices who are not just participating, but leading in global conversations about beauty, identity, and innovation. For Bangladesh, this isn't just a fashion win — it's a cultural one. Zurhem's spotlight at Cannes reaffirms that Bangladeshi creativity is world-class, and its future on the international stage is only just beginning.   Photo: Courtesy

https://www.thedailystar.net//life-living/news/it-doesnt-rain-shukhno-gram-3897386,It doesn’t rain in Shukhno Gram,https://www.thedailystar.net//life-living/news/it-doesnt-rain-shukhno-gram-3897386,"In a forgotten railway station where the rain never falls, a solitary station master's routine is upended by an unexpected visitor in blue. It's a quiet tale of chance, connection, and longing as the romantic story unfolds. When studying economics back in DU, I never imagined that I would end up working at an old, rundown railway station in a desolate, remote village. But here I was: a station master in charge of possibly the least active railway stop in the country. It is called Shukhno Gram Rail Station, named after the village, although the locals call it Hoogna Geram. Why shukno, hoogna, or dry? Because it does not rain around here! Now in my mid-30s, I have been posted at this station for almost a decade — and not a raindrop in my career. My job has its perks, of course. No corporate politics, no Excel sheets; just minor interactions, basic record-keeping, etc. But no exciting stories either. I have become as dry as this village. On a warm May afternoon, a train stopped at my station. I frowned. The first and last train of the day had left several hours ago. A train would stop now only if someone pulled the emergency handle. A minute later — a grunt, followed by a heavy luggage being tossed out, followed by a woman in a blue saree. ""Excuse me! How can I go to Dhaka from here?"" the lady in blue asked, rubbing off beads of sweat below her nose while the train disappeared. I was dumbfounded. There was no easy answer to her question. She had to take muddy roads, trawlers, and local buses to get to the nearest city. After I explained all that, she yearned, ""When is the next train?"" ""Tomorrow noon,"" I replied helplessly. Then, after dragging the luggage to the waiting room, she fell on one of the benches, shut her eyes, and began to rest. I now closely studied this strange woman. The rojonigondha on the wrist contrasted with her dusky skin. The aalta on her palms and fingers gave a festive vibe. Large but not too flamboyant jewellery glistened in the sunlight that poured into the waiting room through large windows. The meticulously draped blue saree hid most of her sweat-drenched black blouse. ""Never seen a beautiful woman before?"" she sleepily taunted, with her eyes still closed! She woke up with a shudder. After recovering and remembering her whereabouts, she let out a sigh. ""Why are you here?"" I eventually addressed the elephant in the room. It was now dark outside. The station was even more desolate at night. The temperature was much cooler, at least by our Hoogna Geram standards, which is a relief, given that electricity is almost always out. Taking a sip from the cup of tea that I offered, she replied flatly, ""I ran."" ""Eloped?"" ""Ran away from my wedding that is taking place in two days,"" she continued. ""I came as far as I could and got down at this random station. This is so childish. I will go back tomorrow."" I looked at her helplessly. ""And why are you here?"" now she asked me back. ""What do you mean, why I'm here? I am the station master."" She slowly got up from the bench and took a seat beside me. ""No, really, why are you here? You seem to be a nice, talented man wasting and rotting his life away in this place."" I had not been confronted with this question in a long time! Graduating from economics, while my friends frantically applied for corporate jobs or started their own businesses, I walked around the campus aimlessly. You see, I always wanted to be an artist. But instead of Charukala, I chose economics, doing what I thought would be the right thing to do. My desire to paint never went away. And so, after I was done with studies, I couldn't help but paint and travel, leaving economics forever. That was how I discovered this place. I settled here because there was no one to bug me, and I was in love with the beauty of the village — the blazing krishnachura blooms, the muddy pathways, crystal-clear skies, and quiet and stillness. ""I want to see your art,"" she told me after hearing all this. I showed her some sketches — a large banyan tree just outside the station, trains arriving and departing, my guard dog Bhulu and his pals who made this station their home, a colleague and friend who worked in another shift, the baul who often visits me for a chat, but most of all, harrowing scenes of droughts of the Shukhno Gram.   She was moved, touched, and shocked to know that it never rains here. Then, she playfully declared, ""If it rains before my train comes, I will not return to Dhaka and stay here!"" ""Ok Google, will it rain today?"" — I asked my phone, to which Google remained silent. Network issues! She chuckled, leaning against a wall. ""You won't get so lucky!"" Warm rays of the morning sun shot at her face, so much so that she couldn't keep her eyes open properly. But she held her pose — leaned on the wall sideways — as I busily dipped my paintbrush on the palette and focused on the canvas in front of me. I painted furiously: locks of hair, large earrings, blue saree, olive-toned skin, white petals, red aalta. ""You didn't tell me last night why you eloped,"" I continued. ""Does it matter? Aren't you glad that I did?"" I let it go. She told me many things yesterday — her job in a management consultancy and how much she hated it, her friends and family who by now must be really worried about her, and how much she loved this saree that belonged to her mum and decided to wear it at the pre-wedding party that she eventually escaped from. But she didn't tell me why she escaped. By the time I laid down my paintbrush, it was almost time for the train to arrive.  She stared at the canvas in awe. ""Do you really find me so beautiful? You keep it. Put it in a gallery one day and invite me to your exhibition when you become a famous artist!"" I brought her luggage to the platform. ""No rain,"" I sighed. ""No rain, sorry!"" she reiterated and laughed. ""Go home and sleep. I wanna be alone for a while. Your shift has ended a long time ago anyway."" ""So, is the wedding back on?"" She turned pensive, paused, and announced again, ""It didn't rain."" Shukhno Gram Rail Station became smaller and smaller as I looked on while sitting at the back of a rickshaw-van. When the building got rather tiny, I heard a rumble — a thunder! Rahim Miah braked. ""Station master, what is happening?"" A cold breeze. Grey clouds. A lightning. Another thunder! ""Take me back to the station! Hurry!"" The villagers were out on the meadows and fields. Children ran out of their school. Farmers looked at the sky in disbelief. Energy and anticipation swept through. But it doesn't rain in Shukhno Gram, remember? It may show some false hope once or twice a year, only to break people's hearts again and again. The grey clouds soon subsided, and the skies were clear. This village is cursed. By the time I rushed back to the station, it was like any other day -- hot, humid, dry. The short-lived hope of a downpour was gone, and so was the train. I turned back wearily to go home.  Suddenly, someone called out, ""Excuse me! I think I missed a train."" I know this voice. I turned around again. There she was — all smiles — my bride in blue!   Model: Shababa Rashid

For the elderly, however, this is rarely sufficient. Their bodies could have difficulties adjusting to heat, and in more grave cases, present serious health hazards. If you are worried about protecting your elderly loved ones from the scorching heat that is sweeping over the country, take the necessary steps towards better health now. Keeping a towel in the fridge might work wonders. When placed over the shoulders or legs, it cools the skin gently and safely without leaving the person feeling jarringly chilled by ice or freezing packs. In fact, cooling is not just about AC or fans. Wet cloths can be applied to the different pulse points around the body including the neck, wrists, or behind the knees to help with reducing core body temperature. While full showers sound like heaven in summer, sponge baths with lukewarm water and a soft cloth works best for the elderly. It soaks their body gently, and is especially important for those having heart or blood-pressure issues since abrupt changes in temperature can be harmful. Another simple yet effective thing would be to keep soothing products in the fridge. This could be anything from lotions, to misting sprays, to even small pillowcases. Its cold application can provide relief from skin irritation produced by heat. In particular cases, elderly people can use mist sprays over their arms, legs, or face when they feel that they are suffering from itchy skin in the heat. Through evaporation, this is a good cooling option and pairs well with a fan. At times, medications are also known to influence elderly people with increased sensitivity to heat. This is because some medicines may interfere with water retention or heat regulation, raising the temperature sensitivity of an individual. If you are concerned regarding this, have a doctor or pharmacist go through all prescriptions and see what adjustments could be made to the medication on days of extreme heat. During heatwaves, one should not underestimate the need for breathable feet. Coax your elders into wearing sandals or perhaps a soft slipper around the house to keep their feet from overheating. That being said, avoid rubber or plastic on hot floors, as they actually trap heat and add to general discomfort. Last but not the least, focus on food for elders' hydration. Heavy, warm meals tend to increase the core temperature of the body.

They show up like New Year's resolutions: full of grand declarations but barely making it past February. You've seen them. Heard them. Probably muted them on social media. Wrapped in oversized hoodies while sipping overpriced hot chocolate, they post things like, ""I miss the warmth of summer,"" or ""I just want to feel the sun again."" Well, guess what? Summer is here. And Dhaka — this summer isn't just hot — it's being cooked. Not metaphorically, not poetically — literally. With temperatures steadily hitting 38-40°C and humidity smacking you in the face, stepping out at 3 PM now feels like entering a malfunctioning sauna that charges you extra even for breathing. Office-goers look like they've run marathons, and schoolchildren resemble survivors of some science experiment involving lava. The air no longer moves — it hovers. And the sun? It doesn't shine. It taunts, harasses, and assaults. Less ""Hello, sunshine"" and more ""Kneel before me, mortals"" kind of attitude these days. The dust sticks. The sweat stings. The overhead fans are basically decorative at this point. And the biggest betrayal of all? Power cuts. In 2025. During heatwaves. Let that sink in — though nothing sinks anymore except morale. And this is practically the new normal. Some days feel like 46°C in Dhaka, unless a moody cloud gets emotional and decides to cry over Mohammadpur. Basically, the city has transformed into a full-fledged urban heat island — thanks to our unholy alliance with carbon emissions and concrete jungles. Even the crows — nature's most shameless noisemakers — have fallen ominously silent in this heat. You know it's hot when the crows go quiet. Interestingly enough, another species has gone quiet — the one I was talking about in the first place. Yes, the Summer Sentimentalists. Remember them? The sun-craving poets of January? They've vanished faster than a Wi-Fi signal during load-shedding. No more sun-drenched Instagram stories with Coldplay in the background. No more tweets romanticising the smell of sunscreen and mangoes. These once-vocal admirers of vitamin D have gone radio silent — probably lying face-down in air-conditioned rooms, regretting every word they ever said about ""missing summer."" To track the current activity of this curious species, we conducted a quick lifestyle census (we cornered some sweaty pedestrians). It revealed the new migration map of the former summer enthusiasts! We found that a large group of them are now air-conditioned mall hoppers, suspiciously lingering in shopping centres — not buying, just breathing. Another group has turned into amphibians, living in buckets or under showers. They now prefer water to emotions. Still, there are some flat-out denialists. ""It's not that bad,"" claims Ismot, who prefers not to go out because he might faint in this heat. Now the question is, dear denialists, if you truly love summer, why are you hiding behind your double-glazed windows and quietly deleting those ""I love summer"" Instagram posts from 2019? Go out. Bathe in the sun. Show your love for the season — if you dare! Meanwhile, the brave few — the delivery riders, street vendors, and rickshaw pullers — are carrying the city on their sunburnt shoulders. Let's be honest, they are the true summer warriors. So, if you're still claiming you're a summer person, it's time to prove it. Go out, touch some sunlight, and take a walk from Farmgate to Shahbagh at 1 PM. Then come back and tell us how romantic the heat felt on your third-degree tan. Because this isn't Tuscany. This is Tejgaon in May. And no, we don't want to see you reposting some reel with ""Summer breeze makes me feel fine…"" while sitting next to a table fan the size of a UFO. Sure, we still have mangoes, sugarcane juice, and the occasional unexpected evening rain that feels like nature's apology letter. But let's be real — the season has changed. Summer in Dhaka is no longer a mood. It's apocalyptic! So, to all the summer lovers out there: Either come out and own it, or stop posting mango-filtered lies. We see your thermostat! It's set to ""Antarctica,"" and we're not fooled! নুসরাত ফারিয়াকে আজ মঙ্গলবার সকালে জামিন দেওয়া হয়।",2025-05-15T16:13:30+06:00
https://www.thedailystar.net//life-living/lifehacks/news/surviving-bangladeshs-heatwave-ac-free-solutions-3895301,Surviving Bangladesh's heatwave: AC-Free solutions,https://www.thedailystar.net//life-living/lifehacks/news/surviving-bangladeshs-heatwave-ac-free-solutions-3895301,"As a heatwave sweeps across the country, many of us feel exhausted and restless all day. To combat the fatigue, it is not enough to stay indoors only — we also need to make sure the environment inside is cool and refreshing. While air conditioning is our go-to solution, we often tend to forget about the high-power usage, affordability issues, and technical difficulties. To tackle the harsh sun this year, here are a few alternative cooling techniques you can follow to stay energised throughout the day, without depending on an AC. More often than not, a cluttered room can obstruct natural air flow, causing the room to trap heat. To regulate the indoor temperature, keeping your room clean and minimal can play a crucial role. Get rid of bulky furniture, heavy textiles and fabrics so that air can travel inside your room smoothly. Remove items with heat-retaining materials like wool or velvet. Make sure to keep your flooring free of thick rugs — it will naturally feel cooler underfoot. Think of rearranging your furniture in a way that ensures lots of open space, as it ensures breezes to distribute cool air evenly throughout the room. One of the most cost-effective ways to block the heat in your room is to place a wet sheet, preferably cotton-made light-coloured fabric by the window. As warm air from outside flows through the moist fabric, it draws heat out of the air, cooling it before it enters your room. This age-old technique works like a natural air-conditioner! Make sure to rewet the sheet every couple of hours to continue the cooling effect. Placing a bowl of ice, frozen water bottles, or an ice pack in front of your portable fan can drastically cool down the room. In case you are using a ceiling fan only, keep a bucket full of ice or cold water in the room to achieve the same results. During the peak heat hours, this process can offer instant relief from the sweltering heat. This method is somewhat energy-efficient, and a quick and practical way to create a cool zone in any room. Did you know lighting has a strong impact on indoor temperatures? Traditional incandescent and halogen bulbs emit a significant amount of heat — making the surroundings feel uncomfortable. To avoid that, opt for energy-efficient LED bulbs, which not only consume less electricity, but also emit very little heat in comparison. If you are open to investing a little for a more effective cooling solution, a dehumidifier can be a smart choice. These devices work by eliminating excess moisture from the air, which in turn, helps maintain a cool environment. As a heatwave makes humidity levels reach higher, your skin feels sticky even if you are indoors. Keeping humidity under control can make sure you have a fresh atmosphere in the room, leaving you feeling comfortable. To make your home a little cosier and cooler in summer, make sure of proper cross ventilation in the room, so that fresh air can pass through the room without difficulty. If your room is situated on the west side where the heat gets harsher, opt for dark and double-layered curtains to reduce heat gain into your room. If your home is right underneath the rooftop, you can wet the rooftop floor to keep your ceiling cool during the peak hours. Use plenty of greens by the windows and balconies to improve the air quality of your home. নুসরাত ফারিয়াকে আজ মঙ্গলবার সকালে জামিন দেওয়া হয়।",2025-05-15T16:09:31+06:00
https://www.thedailystar.net//campus/campus/news/what-made-kaaktaals-journey-so-special-and-memorable-3898401,What made Kaaktaal’s journey so special and memorable,https://www.thedailystar.net//campus/campus/news/what-made-kaaktaals-journey-so-special-and-memorable-3898401,"The first time I heard Kaaktaal live, hundreds of people crowded my former school's auditorium under the bright lights. The second occasion was far more intimate, with a small-scale audience sitting on the floor of an indoor venue as the band mesmerised everyone with their art. Despite the sheer disparity in settings, there was something quietly magical about two men with their guitar, flute, and unparalleled storytelling. Such has been the defining nature of Kaaktaal, a collaborative musical effort — primarily made up of Asif ""AiA Lemonsky"" Iqbal and Nazm Anwr — that is as spontaneous and unassuming as its name suggests. However, like their art and growth in the scene, the band announced an indefinite hiatus and a step back from music out of the blue on May 17. The announcement was concise and honest, stating that ""the journey needs to stop here, because it's losing its peace."" In a way, this decision was cathartic for both the group and their fans. Kaaktaal was never one to chase fame. In the past year alone, they published about 20 new songs, but there were hardly any major marketing campaigns or advertisements that followed any of their releases. Instead, it felt as though they were meant to be savoured at the moment, like fleeting conversations. They simply existed, and in doing so, found their way into people's hearts when they needed it the most. Take their single ""Shohosha"" from their latest album, KaaktaalRaw Volume 06, for example. With a soothing backdrop of a simple guitar riff, AiA explores a deeply introspective trip of feeling lost in an abruptly changing world — a feeling that hits close to home for many. In ""Ghorchara"", one of their earliest singles, the group reminisces the scattered memories of their childhood and the place they grew up in. It also talks about the painful trial of stepping out of a place for good and leaving behind a displaced part of yourself. While Kaaktaal's discography features a vast catalogue of emotionally resonant songs, they've never shied away from creating resistance through music either. During the student-led uprising last year, they released ""Rokto Gorom Matha Thanda"" to call out everyone complicit in the systemic, widespread violence caused by the former regime. But the one aspect that makes Kaaktaal's journey all the more memorable is, perhaps, the simplicity and down-to-earth nature of their arrangements. Musically, they thrived on making songs that had minimal distractions. AiA's guitar laid the foundation, Nazm's flute added a transportative calmness, and percussionist Joven carried the rhythm section with grace.  Live shows weren't different either as they were often small, intimate, and unpolished by design. The band didn't rely on big productions or flashy presentations as the music did all the talking. Clever and intentional medleys, alternate arrangements, and unplugged versions — these were all trademarks of any Kaaktaal show, giving the audience a completely unique experience each time. On a more personal level, I feel dejected at the band's hiatus. It's difficult to explain the excitement of seeing a sudden YouTube notification from the band at midnight or the thrill of watching them perform live again and again. But deep down, I'm glad that they stayed true to their promise of making music for as long as the music didn't leave them. Now, all I can hope is that one day, they regain as much peace in creating music as I — and many others — found in listening to it.  Join Ayaan as he sobs on the floor while listening to ""Chorki"" at [email protected]

https://www.thedailystar.net//campus/campus/news/are-late-night-study-sessions-effective-3894621,Are late night study sessions effective?,https://www.thedailystar.net//campus/campus/news/are-late-night-study-sessions-effective-3894621,"As the world drifts into slumber, the quiet symphony of flickering desk lamps and rustling pages accompanies the solitary student studying late into the night. The solitude of the silent hours sets the stage for nocturnal study sessions, where late-night reading and practice tests replace sleep. Students regularly pull all-nighters as a coping mechanism to deal with the horrors of academic pressure. Whether a dedicated night owl or a last-minute crammer, staying up late to study is a staple of the student experience for all. The appeal of night-time studying often stems from necessity rather than preference. Daytime usually pass in juggling class schedules and extra-curriculars, with most students finding it challenging to allocate sufficient time for self-evaluation. Thus, as burning the midnight oil to catch up on coursework starts looking like a fair exchange, sleep transforms into a luxury that feels almost unattainable. However, do late-night study sessions truly offer the environment conducive to learning and self-evaluation that individuals desire? For many, studying during the night is their only option. The importance of comfortable, personal study spaces is undeniable; however, many students don't have access to these spaces. For instance, growing up in overcrowded households usually means there is an absence of quiet corners so maintaining focus turns into a constant battle against distractions. For those living in bustling metropolitans, their ability to concentrate is compromised by incessant vehicular noises and chaotic clutter. As a response, many turn to late-night studying as a final resort. According to research conducted at the University of Notre Dame, people who stay up late perform better in terms of memory retention. This phenomenon is attributed to what experts call 'retroactive interference'. Studying during the daytime leads to interruptions and the continual influx of new information which increases the likelihood of forgetting previously learned material. The brain can understand information more efficiently before sleep, enhancing the ability to recall important details. Furthermore, people with short attention spans and those who depend on last-minute work for their exams sometimes find themselves performing better during the after-hours. The adrenaline rush of working against a deadline heightens motivation, turning procrastination into a driving force for productivity. When exam seasons loom, many students rely on cramming overnight to get by. However, studying during odd hours comes with significant health risks, primarily rooted in a lack of sleep disrupting a person's biological clock. Chronic sleep deprivation can lead to long-term health problems. Research shows that consistently staying up late affects the body's circadian rhythms, which regulate sleep-wake cycles, hormone production, and metabolism. Over time, this disruption can increase the risk of cardiovascular disease, obesity, and weakened immune function. Sleep deprivation also takes a toll on mental health. Missing out on sleep temporarily boosts dopamine levels, constructing a feeling of short-term euphoria. This short-lived high can impair decision-making and lead to impulsive behaviour. For students who constantly rely on studying during the night, these effects may accumulate and lead to a decrease in overall academic performance and well-being. Despite offering a short-term solution, studying past midnight often leads to diminished productivity throughout the following day. Lack of sleep makes it harder to build focus during classes, retain new information, or participate fully in academic discussions. As a result, students may find themselves trapped in a cycle of exhaustion, where they are constantly catching up but failing to get ahead. With the fleeting benefits of late-night studying weighed against its lasting toll, the question remains: is it a sustainable practice? The choice narrows down to whether the short bursts of focus at night are worth the long-term consequences. For those who feel trapped by the chaos of daytime, one approach could be shifting study hours to early mornings when thought processes sharpen and the surrounding environment is still calm. Studying in public spaces like libraries or reading cafes can also provide a focused atmosphere without the need to stay up late. Ultimately, the goal is to find a balance supporting both effective learning and overall well-being. References: 1. Notre Dame News (March 23, 2012).

https://www.thedailystar.net//campus/news/the-lives-international-medical-students-bangladesh-3894586,The lives of international medical students in Bangladesh,https://www.thedailystar.net//campus/news/the-lives-international-medical-students-bangladesh-3894586,"Many of us have thought of pursuing a degree abroad. If we were to set aside the practical aspects of this process and instead shift our focus on to the emotional toll that it takes on a student, we would notice phases of excitement mixed with dashes of fear and anxiety. Excitement because the student would get to experience a whole new country – all on their own – possibly for the first time in their life. Fear precisely because they would be in a whole new country, all alone, thousands of miles away from their loved ones. It could be one of the most unique experiences in a student's life. Now imagine if the country the student is flying into was Bangladesh. Many of the universities in Bangladesh have foreign students studying a range of subjects. But by far, the degree most foreign students come to pursue is a Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery (MBBS). Currently, 221 out of 5380 seats are reserved for foreign students in government colleges. In private colleges, a large fraction of the intake can be foreign students. Currently, there are over 10,000 medical students only from India. Students from Pakistan, Nepal, Jammu and Kashmir, and even Palestine come to study MBBS here. To get an overview of their experiences, Campus reached out to a few international students and had them discuss numerous aspects of their lives in Bangladesh. ""Everything about leaving your country and your comfort zone and moving to a different part of the world is challenging. A big challenge is adjusting to the environment and culture,"" said Isaaq N Namoura, A fifth-year student from Palestine studying at Shaheed Suhrawardy Medical College. ""There's a language barrier present here. When I started off, I didn't know that classes would be in Bangla. I didn't get to take a Bangla course when I first came over. English was challenging too as it isn't my first language, and neither is it for my teachers'. So, we struggled to communicate a lot in the beginning. Now that I've learned Bangla though, conversing has become much easier. However, the curriculum should definitely include an introductory course in Bangla,"" he added. Another student from Assam, Angela Shirin, studying at Holy Family Red Crescent Medical College said, ""MBBS is tough, and being away from home, especially when you see your mates going home every weekend, is super hard. For instance, if I get homesick right now, I need to cross an entire country to go home. And the hardest part is you never know if things at home are going to be the same as when you left. The constant fear and worry about my family take a toll on me. Among the challenges I've had to overcome and adapt to, the climate ranks number one. It's way too hot and humid out here. The language barrier had been a problem, but with time I got a handle on it. All you need to do is learn these words: mama, baam pashe, daan pashe, shomosshha nai."" When asked about her clinical experience and interacting with patients, she said, ""I remember a humorous interaction where I was asked to palpate the liver of a middle-aged man. I struggled to ask him to move his shirt aside. I blurted out something close in Bangla, but the patient didn't quite understand what I was trying to say. He proceeded to reply in a different dialect perhaps, but I couldn't grasp it. So, I acted out what I wanted him to do, which was when he finally understood."" ""I think the Bangla word for lung is very funny. I chuckle a bit every time I come across a patient with some lung pathology,"" she added. Having a social life, making friends, or finding job opportunities for some extra cash is made difficult not only by the language barrier but by the cultural barrier as well. Settling into hostel culture and interacting with locals poses its own set of challenges. Regarding this, Isaaq said, ""The whole new experience, the whole new set of regulations, culture, and people is exciting to me. The other thing I didn't even realise is I'd enjoy electricity and running water 24/7. This isn't a privilege we always have in Palestine. So, it really provides some much-needed perspective."" Naveed Shahrier, a final-year student from Kashmir said, ""Managing your social life is something that isn't addressed enough. It starts with your hostel roommates and batch mates. Often, what begins as congenial friendships grow colder over time. Most of the time, you feel a burden of loneliness. It's a situation that cannot be easily communicated to someone who hasn't experienced being in a foreign land."" He also spoke about the availability of job opportunities for foreign students, ""If you see a Kashmiri in the streets of Dhaka, he's either a shawl vendor selling our renowned shawls or a medical student studying in a private medical college. For pocket money, a few foreign students have found a niche as social media influencers. It's apparently a good source of income. One of my juniors, Abhishek Jajariya, a Rajasthani third-year student, has been doing inspirational work. He's cashing in six figures a month providing online tutoring to junior students and acting as a consultant. Besides this, many students vlog about their experience here and get endorsement deals. Many Kashmiris are also sought by modelling agencies to pose for local brands."" As for the quality of education and cooperation from faculty members, Angela remarked that faculty members from her college have been friendly and considerate. ""They always consider granting us additional leave, empathise with us, and also understand the difficulties of living so far from home for long stretches,"" she said. Looking back at the tumultuous times of the July uprising in 2024, she explained, ""I was really touched (by the faculty members' conduct) when chaos built up in Bangladesh last year. All colleges were shut down and we were stuck here. A few of the teachers were really concerned and made sure we got home safely. In addition, we addressed our concerns about not resuming classes right away."" ""Not only were they considerate enough to postpone the items (daily viva exams) till we arrived but also assured us that we could take the exams online or when we came back to Bangladesh, if we missed it. I have always openly shared my problems, be it personal or academic, with some of the teachers, and they have always been helpful,"" she said. Although Bangladesh welcomes a considerable number of medical students every year, there still remains a lot to account for if we truly want to be a hub for medical education. The Directorate General for Health Services (DGHS), for instance, could take steps to improve the experience of foreign students pursuing an MBBS degree in Bangladesh.  Munna Yadav, a student from Nepal at Dhaka Medical College said, ""Bangladesh is a prime destination for medical education, as there is good clinical exposure here with high patient flow. Yet some hurdles persist. Foreign students doing internships at government medical colleges do not receive any compensation. Some private colleges do pay, but there is a lack of uniformity there as well."" ""Besides, private medical colleges don't provide enough information about their institutions online or in circulars, which makes the process of direct admission tough. It also forces many to rely on consultancies. The country often goes through spells of political turmoil but there is no government body or special unit from the DGHS to counsel or reassure foreign students about their safety. These issues are holding this sector back and need to be addressed,"" he elaborated. Prof. Md Mustafizur Rahman, former Vice-Principal of Shaheed Suhrawardy Medical College, stated that Bangladesh is a hub for medical education in South Asia due to the quality of education being offered, exposure to a broad spectrum of clinical cases, and the low cost at which the education is being offered. However, there is still room for improvement.  ""Our faculty members are very conscious about the needs of international students, even more so than our domestic students sometimes because we acknowledge international students may have a hard time fitting in here and naturally may require closer attention and care. Yes, we have space for improvement when it comes to accommodation and one-stop services for these students. We hope by incorporating these facilities in the future, Bangladesh will secure its place as an ideal destination for medical education,"" he said. As things stand, we are offering quality medical education at a competitive price compared to the global market. However, a unified and transparent approach to the admission process for foreign nationals, which would be applicable to all medical colleges, is of utmost necessity. Special counsellors also have to be assigned by the DGHS for any emergency needs the students may have. And though the medium of education will remain in English, incorporating an introductory Bangla language course for foreign students will go a long way in helping them interact with patients better. The place where one completes their undergraduate becomes a second home of sorts. With that in mind, it should be our holistic goal to provide these individuals – who have left their homelands to study in our medical colleges – a standardised academic experience as well as an amiable social experience. It is our hope that if they return to their homelands, they will remember their alma mater with fondness and Bangladesh as a second home.

The new show had big shoes to fill, and for the most part, it succeeds in being a worthy continuation of the original show with a stellar storyline, well-developed characters and brutal action sequences. The story takes place several years after the ending of the original series. Matt Murdock, having abandoned his superhero identity, is compelled to return when Wilson Fisk (The Kingpin) becomes New York's mayor and begins a conspiracy to outlaw masked vigilantes while expanding his criminal empire. Before starting the critical analysis, it is important to note that halfway through production, the show went through a complete creative overhaul. Essentially, before the show had fewer connections both in terms of tone and storyline to the previous series. They included previously completed episodes but also added new content that connected it to the Netflix series. The show's resulting mixture of two different visions is apparent, with episodes clearly distinguishable as pre- and post-overhaul. The weakest parts of the show are the pre-overhaul episodes. While it starts off solid, the plot progresses very slowly, with Matt not suiting up as Daredevil for quite a long time. The newer supporting characters are not as nuanced or likeable as Foggy Nelson and Karen Page from the original series, and it is even more evident when those characters eventually show up here. They introduced a new villain named Muse, who began as an intriguing character, but unfortunately, his arc did not live up to its potential. However, other new characters like the superhero White Tiger and Daniel Blake, Fisk's protégé, were genuinely interesting and added depth to the narrative. That being said, the rest of the show proves why Charlie Cox's Daredevil remains arguably the best-written hero in the MCU. His rivalry and dynamic with Vincent D'Onofrio's Kingpin continues to be iconic, and the expert cinematography and visual storytelling of the scenes just add icing on the cake to their respective character arcs. Returning characters such as Benjamin Poindexter (Bullseye) and Frank Castle (The Punisher) have their own mini-arcs that further add tension and nuance to the story. Despite the slow build, the character development and overall narrative make the show amazing. The major problem with MCU heroes, such as the Avengers, is that they seldom deal with ""real"" problems that affect everyday people. They're always fighting aliens, monsters, or a threat to the planet or multiverse, and the movies focus heavily on massive CGI battles rather than showing the heroes actually ""save"" civilians. Daredevil actually deals with grounded issues, and this show in particular parallels real-world issues of corrupt people becoming politicians and exploiting average citizens. Besides the obvious parallel between Fisk's election and Trump's presidency, an interesting plot point is also featured where corrupt cops use the Punisher's logo to commit murders, reflecting the real-world misuse of the symbol by American police and far-right white supremacists. Despite a few weaknesses, like the pacing issues and inconsistent episode quality, Daredevil: Born Again is a fantastic show with compelling characters, a narrative that strays away from the standard superhero fare in favour of realistic world building. It is undoubtedly one of the best projects in the MCU in the past few years, and a worthy follow-up to the fan-favourite Netflix show. নুসরাত ফারিয়াকে আজ মঙ্গলবার সকালে জামিন দেওয়া হয়।",2025-05-17T15:17:38+06:00
https://www.thedailystar.net//campus/education/news/struggles-writing-research-paper-undergrad-3892156,Struggles of writing a research paper as an undergrad,https://www.thedailystar.net//campus/education/news/struggles-writing-research-paper-undergrad-3892156,"Have you ever started a research paper with a head full of ideas only to hit a wall mid-way? This is a common experience for many undergrads writing their first research paper. What begins as an exciting dive into a topic can quickly devolve into a frustrating maze of tedious work. Even though the end result is rewarding, the process is filled with roadblocks that might feel insurmountable unless tackled with patience and tact. Struggling with team coordination One of the most challenging aspects of writing a research paper is finding the right team. Initially, teaming up may feel like a brilliant idea — tasks can be easily divided and deadlines seem within reach! But soon you realise it's not that simple. Clashing schedules, different work ethics, and last-minute panics quickly turn what was supposed to be a group effort into a source of stress. To avoid these pitfalls, set clear goals from the beginning, maintain a shared calendar to keep everyone on track, and arrange regular meetings to keep everyone accountable and organised. Difficulty in finding study participants Research relies on valid data, responses from survey findings, or interviews. While reaching out to people for these surveys and interviews, however, oftentimes emails sit unnoticed, messages get ignored, and forms remain incomplete. The clock keeps ticking but you keep not being able to find enough research participants to meet your data requirements. At some point, you start wondering; ""Will I have enough responses to complete this research on time?"" To increase participation and gather sufficient data, diversify your network and cast a wide net through social media, offer incentives to participants, and send follow-up reminders to ensure a timely submission of responses. Facing writer's block Your participants are ready, your research topic is on track, and the deadline is set. But then the dreaded writer's block creeps in. Ideas buzz in your mind, yet the words refuse to take shape and you end up staring at a blank page for hours on end. Every researcher knows this struggle — it's as if a battle is being waged in your mind between thoughts and words while time keeps slipping away. To get the words flowing, outline your thoughts in bullet points before expanding them into paragraphs. Discussing your ideas with a peer may also be the catalyst you need to spark creativity. The challenge of understanding unfamiliar topics Writing a paper becomes more challenging when tackling a topic you know little about. Starting a paper on an unfamiliar topic can be overwhelming in and of itself; limited online resources for primary research can further complicate this process. Although this obstacle is manageable over time and with effort, the initial lack of knowledge often feels like a significant hurdle, making it difficult to know where to begin. To understand your topic clearly, reach out to professors or experts and form study groups with classmates who have a stronger grasp of the topic and can share valuable insights and resources. Formatting and citation Citations are far more than a formality in academic writing. They are necessary for maintaining academic integrity and safeguarding against plagiarism. The problem with this final part of the paper begins with understanding the different styles of citation — APA, MLA, Chicago, and more. From punctuation placement to italicisation, the slightest mistake can undermine the credibility of an otherwise well-organised paper. Moreover, the fear of plagiarism looms large — forgetting to cite a source can have serious academic consequences. To keep track of your sources and ensure correct formatting, use citation management tools online or consult with a librarian to ensure accuracy. The pressure of balancing research with coursework A good paper needs constant effort to make progress. However, just when you think you are making progress, a string of assignments, project work, and quizzes pile up at your university. The constant switch between tasks makes it difficult to focus and research often gets sidelined. Finding a balanced routine to prioritise academics without neglecting your research becomes hard. To reduce the pressure, employ time management techniques like the Pomodoro method, which breaks work down into 25-minute intervals with short breaks, to enhance focus. If needed, discuss workload management with academic advisors to find a balanced approach. The entire research process can lead to burnout with you constantly doubting your every effort. However, it is important to see these obstacles as part of the learning process. Each struggle is a chance to build critical thinking abilities and time management skills. And, in the end, it all feels worthwhile when you finally see your work getting published and gaining recognition from your peers.  Nusrat Meherin Faiza is a writer, tutor, and chronic overthinker.

Late nights? Banned. Junk food? Dream on. Spontaneous outings? Only if they involved groceries. Screen time? Monitored like a national security threat. But somehow, the older I got, the more I realised those no's weren't roadblocks; they were safety nets. Back then, it felt unfair. While my friends lived the best life—junk food, sleepovers, Netflix marathons—I was indoors doing homework under the watchful eyes of General Mom. I called it ""house arrest"". She called it ""parenting"". But here's the thing I didn't realise until much later: she wasn't trying to ruin my life; she was trying to shape it. While I saw restrictions, she saw protection. While I sulked about rules, she was silently building me a future where I'd thank her for every ""no"" she ever said. But with time, things changed. One day, curious about her sudden chill mode, I asked why she wasn't as strict anymore. She looked at me with that knowing smile and said, ""There's a time for everything."" No long explanation; just one of those quiet truths she always seems to carry in her back pocket. We expect mothers to be superhuman. Warmth on demand, food on the table, patience always stocked, and a smile through every chaos. But we forget – this is her first time too. She is figuring things out as she goes, making mistakes, getting back up, and doing it all over again. Coming to working moms? Absolute legends. They clock out of the office and clock into their second job without flinching. Stay-at-home moms? Equally heroic, running homes like CEOs, minus the bonuses and coffee breaks. Society often praises what it can see – promotions, paychecks, performance reviews. But motherhood is measured in lullabies sung through exhaustion, meals cooked without complaint, lessons taught through patience, and love given endlessly, even when none is returned. To every mother – whether you're balancing board meetings and baby bottles, or spending your days running a home that never pauses – you are more than enough. And my mom? She juggled both roles. She worked a full-time job and still made time for spelling tests, fever checks, surprise Tupperware hunts, and emotional therapy sessions disguised as dinner chats. I, of course, still found reasons to complain – cold food, a house not organised, and clothes not ironed (my own fault, but still). So if you ever wonder what a superhero looks like—don't look up. Look home. She's probably in the kitchen reheating your food... again. So, here's to the unsung hero in every home. To every mother – who makes love look easy, patience look endless, and multitasking look magical. Because let's face it—if motherhood were a paid job, no company could afford the salary. নুসরাত ফারিয়াকে আজ মঙ্গলবার সকালে জামিন দেওয়া হয়।",2025-05-11T19:37:45+06:00
https://www.thedailystar.net//tech-startup/news/realme-14-5g-budget-beast-built-mobile-gaming-3898766,Realme 14 5G: A budget beast built for mobile gaming,https://www.thedailystar.net//tech-startup/news/realme-14-5g-budget-beast-built-mobile-gaming-3898766,"We recently got our hands on the Realme 14 5G. But before we dive into the review, have a bit of patience for a nostalgic reminiscence. Back in the day, waking up at 6 AM to rain meant no school. Instead, you just turn on your PC while your mother makes your favourite meal. But this time we gave away to nostalgia by ramping up the Realme 14 5G before we have to eventually go into the office amidst the heavy rain outside (even if we don't want to). But did the gaming performance of the device make it easier for us to deal with a hectic day ahead in the office? Let's cut to the chase. If you're a gamer on a shoestring budget, the Realme 14 5G is the closest you will get to a pocket-sized esports rig without breaking the bank. From its blisteringly smooth AMOLED screen to a stamina-marathon battery, Realme has clearly prioritised what matters most to teen and young adult gamers and, in the process, created a handset that can be appealing at BDT 41,999. At 7.97 mm thin and 196 g, the Realme 14 5G strikes a pleasing balance between sleekness and solidity. While the device has a moderate size bezel, the bezel is a bit larger at the lower side of the device and the front camera is also outside the bezel. The matte-finish back resists fingerprints, and the subtle metallic sheen of mecha silver looks premium and futuristic but the plastic feels makes it a bit disappointing. Better still, the IP66/IP68/IP69 ratings ensure it shrugs off dust, rain or even an accidental splash ideal for those impromptu gaming sessions on the go. The 6.67-inch AMOLED Esports Display with 1080x2400 FHD+ resolution is a standout. With a 120 Hz refresh rate, 180 Hz touch sampling (peaking at 1,500 Hz) and up to 2,000 nits peak brightness, animations glide by without delay, and colours pop even under harsh daylight. Whether you're racing on nitro or running through Erangel or catching up on Netflix, the fluidity and vibrancy is close to many flagship phones. Under the hood sits Qualcomm's Snapdragon 6 Gen 4 5G chipset, built on a 4 nm processor and paired with up to 12 GB RAM along with dynamic expansion options, coupled with 256 GB storage. We tested 3 AAA games and the device delivered like a 'smooth criminal'. It can handle high frame rates, which is pretty rare in phones of this price segment. Third-person shooting games like PUBG mobile feels dynamic; the display feels a bit bigger, complemented by minimal lags, high response, and refresh rate when tilted. We suppose this is what Realme wanted when they said the phone had an 'esports' display. Interestingly, after long hours of playing, we have seen very little heat generation which amplifies the mobile's efficiency and stability in gaming. The device has a 50 MP AI OIS main camera, a 2 MP macro for close-ups and a 16 MP front camera. Though the sharpness and camera preview is questionable, the main camera captures well-balanced shots in daylight, while portrait and night modes apply just enough algorithmic polish without venturing into cartoon territory. There is also a 'street mode' which lets you zoom to the subject of the photo with a single tap, along with a 'pro' mode and a 'movie' mode which helps control ISO and shutter speed, among others. While the wide-angle shots are missing due to the camera setup, video captures up to 4K at 30 fps with 60 fps option in 720 p and 1080p. There is also a 'dual-view' mode that can record front and rear footage simultaneously, handy for reaction videos. When using its camera, we also saw an underwater mode and quickly got to it. The limit was around 200 centimetres but since we could not find any buckets that big, we submerged it into 25 centimetre deep water and the photos were surprisingly well-detailed. We submerged our friendly neighbourhood spiderman action figure into the water as well and took some photos from around 13 centimetres away from the phone. The results were impressively detailed, with accurate colours and minimal distortion. The 6,000 mAh ""Titan"" battery is a true workhorse. In mixed use (gaming, streaming, browsing), we comfortably stretched to a day of use. When you do run low, 45 W SuperVOOC fast charging gives a superb backup. Gamers who do not like to wait for charging can directly connect the charger through the 'bypass charging' option available in-game toggle. Other than gamers, traditional users can also use this huge battery and RAM capacity towards their advantage in case of multitasking and binging reels all day. Realme UI 6.0 (based on Android 15) offers a clean interface with useful gaming tools in the GT Boost (AI eye comfort for gaming, breathing light effects, game focus mode, network optimisation). Extras include 5G dual mode, in-display fingerprint reader, and 300% speaker volume. Buy it if you want flagship-style gaming performance, a vivid AMOLED screen and marathon-lasting battery life without splashing out. Photos: Md. Zahidur Rabbi

Liang Liang, deputy director of the Beijing Economic-Technological Development Area, emphasised this vision during a recent demonstration of robotic capabilities, according to a recent report by Reuters.    The comments came after China hosted the world's first robot half-marathon last month, where 20 robotic teams competed on a separate track from human runners. Liang described the event as symbolic of how robots and humans will coexist, each developing their own capabilities without direct competition.   ""Robots will handle dangerous tasks like deep-sea exploration or nighttime operations,"" Liang explained, adding they would create ""better, cheaper products"" while humans focus on other work. The official spoke at the Beijing Humanoid Robotics Innovation Centre, which showcased robots including the marathon-winning Tiangong Ultra model capable of 12 km/h speeds.   China is investing heavily in humanoid robotics, with state-backed projects developing machines for both specialised tasks and everyday functions. The technology is seen as crucial for maintaining productivity as China's workforce ages, though officials insist it won't cause mass unemployment. Other prototypes displayed included robots designed to navigate obstacles in changing environments. নুসরাত ফারিয়াকে আজ মঙ্গলবার সকালে জামিন দেওয়া হয়।",2025-05-19T14:42:33+06:00

At the Computex tech trade show in Taiwan on Monday, the company introduced NVLink Fusion, an updated version of its existing NVLink technology. This system enables faster chip-to-chip communication, a crucial part of building powerful AI tools that require multiple chips working together. Nvidia said it plans to make the technology available to other chipmakers, helping them design custom AI hardware more efficiently. The announcement reflects Nvidia's shift from its original focus on graphics chips for video games to a broader role in the AI industry, states a recent report by Reuters on Nvidia's latest announcements. Since the launch of ChatGPT in 2022, demand for high-performance AI chips has surged, placing Nvidia at the centre of the trend. At the event, CEO Jensen Huang also highlighted Nvidia's wider roadmap, adds the report. The company is working on new generations of AI processors, including the Blackwell Ultra, due later this year, and the Rubin series, which will be followed by Feynman chips in 2028. Nvidia also revealed a desktop AI system for researchers, the DGX Spark, which is now in full production and expected to ship in the coming weeks. In addition, Nvidia is developing CPUs that run Microsoft's Windows operating system using technology from Arm Holdings, according to previous reports by Reuters. Computex 2025 marks a major gathering for the tech and chipmaking industry in Asia, with more than 1,400 exhibitors participating, as per the Reuters report. নুসরাত ফারিয়াকে আজ মঙ্গলবার সকালে জামিন দেওয়া হয়।",2025-05-19T11:31:51+06:00

https://www.thedailystar.net//tech-startup/news/disinformation-campaigns-target-women-and-minorities-bangladesh-study-3897691,Disinformation campaigns target women and minorities in Bangladesh: Study,https://www.thedailystar.net//tech-startup/news/disinformation-campaigns-target-women-and-minorities-bangladesh-study-3897691,"  In the lead-up to Bangladesh's January 2024 general elections, Facebook became a digital battlefield—not just for political rhetoric, but for the insidious spread of gender-based disinformation. A study by the Tech Global Institute has shed light on how coordinated networks exploit social media platforms to disseminate gendered abuse, disproportionately targeting women and marginalised communities in Bangladesh. Drawing from an analysis of nearly 25,000 Facebook posts, the research highlights the shortcomings of traditional disinformation frameworks—many of which were developed in the Global North—when applied to complex, hyper-local contexts such as Bangladesh.  In countries like Bangladesh, where digital platforms are increasingly central to political discourse, the weaponisation of gendered abuse online has tangible offline consequences. According to ActionAid, two-thirds of Bangladeshi women have faced some form of online harassment. But during election periods, the stakes are heightened. The Tech Global Institute found that such abuse—ranging from body-shaming and homophobic slurs to sexualised disinformation and threats—was overwhelmingly directed at political figures, especially women from opposition parties. Out of 1,400 posts flagged as gendered attacks, 70% involved sexual insinuations. An additional 18.6% contained discriminatory remarks based on religion, ethnicity or sexual orientation, and 10% focused on behavioural shaming, often with no factual basis. The study critiques existing methodologies for identifying abusive content, many of which rely on English-language lexicons or US-centric case law. These approaches, it argues, fail to capture the fluid, relational nature of abuse in Bangladesh's digital ecosystem. For instance, benign Bengali terms like shamakami (homosexual) are weaponised to feminise and stigmatise political actors, while public figures are frequently compared to pornographic icons as a means of character assassination. Efforts to apply machine-led keyword filters fell short due to the linguistic complexity of Bengali and the widespread use of code-switching between Bengali and English, or ""Banglish"". As a result, the research team adopted a ""human-in-the-loop"" methodology, building an expansive, evolving corpus of harmful terms validated by expert review and iterative testing. The findings reveal a social media ecosystem rife with opaque allegiances and deceptive practices. Pages that ostensibly support one party often spread content aligned with another. Some 700 Facebook Pages posed as news outlets or community organisations, but were in fact hubs of coordinated disinformation campaigns. These networks appeared to centralise their operations. Identical content—often featuring altered images or deepfake videos—was disseminated across multiple Pages and Groups within seconds, amplifying malign narratives and reinforcing harmful gender stereotypes. Crucially, 93% of targeted attacks were directed at individuals unaffiliated with the ruling Awami League, suggesting a strategic use of gendered abuse to silence dissent and consolidate power. While men were not immune—often targeted with slurs questioning their masculinity—women bore the brunt of abuse. The top ten most targeted women were primarily opposition politicians, including Shama Obaid and Rumin Farhana, who faced relentless attacks on their personal lives and fabricated allegations of sexual impropriety. Gender-diverse communities also found themselves targeted. Though Bangladesh legally recognised hijras as a third gender in 2013, terms such as hijra and samakami remain common slurs on political pages. Even prominent figures like Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina were not spared, though she also received supportive coverage in content disparaging her rivals. Perhaps most concerning is the ripple effect: the fear and stigma generated by these attacks risks deterring future generations of women and gender-diverse individuals from entering political life or speaking out on civic issues. Bangladesh's legislative framework includes the Cyber Security Act 2023 and several other statutes criminalising online abuse. Yet enforcement remains inconsistent. Complaints by opposition figures are often dismissed, and victims face the burden of disproving defamatory claims—discouraging formal redress. On the platform level, Meta's policies against hate speech and harassment theoretically provide protection, particularly for public figures at risk. But the study criticises the tech giant's uneven enforcement and its inability to detect contextually-coded abuse in non-English languages. Automated systems frequently overlook subtle or misspelled slurs, while self-reporting mechanisms place an undue burden on the victims themselves.

The US space agency acknowledged his findings with an official letter of appreciation. Born and raised in Jhenaigati, Sherpur, Shuvon passed his SSC from Jhinaigati Govt Model Pilot High School. He then enrolled at Malaysia's University of Cyberjaya, where he is currently pursuing a diploma in Information Technology. Alongside his studies, he works as an Information Security Analyst at ERTH (Blue Bee Technologies Sdn. Bhd.), a technology solutions provider specialising in cybersecurity services. Shuvon's journey into cybersecurity began in Class 7 when he first started learning programming. ""I explored free courses, YouTube tutorials, books, and PDFs,"" Shovon recalls. By Class 8, he was deep into cybersecurity, bug hunting, and hackathons. ""I worked in different tech sectors, like SEO, graphic design, and video editing. But cybersecurity is my true passion,"" he shares. On June 11, 2024, Shuvon uncovered a privacy-related bug in NASA's system. He explains his process of finding the NASA bug: ""First, I studied recent vulnerabilities that others had found and tested them, but none worked. Then, I combined several vulnerabilities and tried an IDOR (Insecure Direct Object Reference) technique with SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery)."" He further explains, ""By chaining these together, I discovered a bug that gave me access to Earth data containing personal information. With this access, someone could have done phishing attacks, sold the data, or used it unethically. I reported it to NASA, and they fixed it."" He adds, ""Before finding NASA's vulnerability, I researched many public reports about bugs. I practised with those methods but couldn't use them properly at first. Eventually, I found NASA's domain where their Earth data was stored, which led to the discovery.""  He responsibly reported the system flaw through the Vulnerability Disclosure Policy (VDP), which is a program by NASA that allows security researchers to legally report system vulnerabilities. By February 2025, NASA acknowledged his contribution with an official appreciation letter, recognising him as an independent security researcher who adhered to ethical guidelines. But NASA wasn't his only high-profile success. Shuvon has also found vulnerabilities in major companies like Sony and Meta. At Sony, he discovered an 'IDOR (Insecure Direct Object Reference) bug' that allowed self-access to unauthorised data, while at Meta, he identified a privacy flaw where hidden reactions in profiles could still be viewed through code manipulation. ""I mainly focus on two types of bugs - IDOR and information disclosure bugs. These are my specialities,"" he explains. Shuvon also achieved the top 1 global rank on TryHackMe, a leading online platform for cybersecurity training and penetration testing challenges, hosting over 2 million users worldwide. When asked about his technical approach to bug-finding, Shuvon explained that he commonly uses tools like Burp Suite, Nuclei, Google Dorks, and platforms such as HackerOne and Bugcrowd to find vulnerable systems. ""Tools help, but success comes from a hacker's mindset - thinking logically and spotting what others miss,"" he adds. Despite global opportunities, Shuvon dreams of contributing to Bangladesh's cybersecurity landscape. According to him, most organisations in Bangladesh don't take digital threats seriously, and there is no proper bug reporting system; as such, he feels that companies need to recruit qualified personnel to read bugs and submit them using a bug reporter. Shuvon shares, ""I want to spread awareness in Bangladesh of the damage bugs can cause. I also want to help develop a bug reporting system for major tech-dependent companies."" His long-term goals are bigger. ""I want to keep learning, help others, and maybe build tools or a company someday,"" he reveals. ""Bug hunting is just the beginning."" নুসরাত ফারিয়াকে আজ মঙ্গলবার সকালে জামিন দেওয়া হয়।",2025-05-18T16:45:36+06:00

It's a familiar scene between me and my unwashed teacups. But today, I wash the fruits. It is one of those days when exhaustion outweighs hunger, when the thought of speaking to the delivery man feels like an unbearable intimacy. I come out of my room, a ghost in my own home, searching for any leftover that I might have forgotten about. Only two bananas and an apple remain in the glass bowl my mother gave me hoping that I might care for myself as much as I do for the aesthetics of this empty house. She sends me curry in ice cream tubs, fruits in shopping bags. Love in disposable containers. I take the apple to the kitchen, turn the faucet. Nothing. I twist harder, my fingers white with urgency. There is no water. I must have forgotten to fill the tank again. I am terrible at this, I whisper to no one. Back at the dining table, I sink into one of the eight chairs, too many for a woman who eats alone. The apple can't be that dirty. I rub it against my sleeve, a pathetic baptism. The first bite is crisp, then. Iron. Blood. There is blood. Whose? Mine? The apple's? My mother's? I rush to the mirror. My gums are pristine, no wound, no sin. But when I look back at the fruit, the truth reveals itself: the flesh is blackened, writhing with tiny, hungry mouths. The rot has teeth. How do I stop the disgust? The punishment of nature for suspension. For all the things I have left undone, unloved, uneaten? The very act of preservation feels like betrayal. And suddenly the room exhales winter. The floors are coated in dust, the teacups cradle curdled milk at their bottoms. And then I see her. My mother stands in the doorway, her mouth sewn shut with coarse black thread. In her hands, a new bowl of fruit, fresh, glistening, perfect. She places it on the table. The threads in her mouth loosen, drip honey. ""You let everything spoil,"" she hums, though her lips never part. The apple in my hand pulses, a second heartbeat. I press it to my ear. I hear it's weeping.

Their purpose was to enjoy an evening of stories and writings curated by Sehri Tales. Sister Library, in collaboration with Sehri Tales, hosted a writing prompt on two significant themes: 'Pink' and 'Digital'. A multitude of writings from all over Bangladesh, as well as some from Pakistan, poured in. And so, the event commenced with a promise of memorable tales about memory, femininity, modernity, identity, and more. The evening began with a speech by Katerina Don, the co-founder and creative director of CholPori. She warmly welcomed everyone to the event while also introducing its premise to the audience. Afterwards, Sabrina Fatma Ahmed, the creator of Sehri Tales, was called on stage to talk about her project. Sabrina told the audience how this year's Sehri Tales was a bit different from previous years, as they moved away from Talespeople, a Facebook group where writers would typically post their works, to a more public forum as a result of the overwhelming response they got from enthusiastic writers. She drew out the 10 years she spent on this project, and later moved on to read two pieces she wrote from the prompts, 'Pink' and 'Digital'. The moderator for the evening, Zaima Hamid Zoa, called several writers on stage, each of whom then presented their writings on the prompts. The writers' pieces captured the nuances of being a female online at this time and age, while also exploring other facets of femininity, such as women's difficult relationship with the colour pink and girlhood. They explored the dangers that women face online, as well as the ideological differences an individual feels from being chronically online.  After the Bangladeshi writers were done reading their stories aloud, the Pakistani writers were connected via Google Meet to read their stories and poems. The first writer, Umar Ahmad, recited a poem on the prompt, 'Pink', while the second, Zara Asad, recited a poem dedicated to her best friend. Ammara Naeem, the third and final poet, read out her poem about the dichotomies of masculinity and femininity.  The evening closed with a zine-making workshop, with the prompt ""A Safe Space"". Sabrina Fatma Ahmad commented that, ever since they had gone more public with Talespeople, female participants showed more reservations because they didn't feel safe enough to share their pieces on a public forum online. This sentiment was what prompted the subject matter of the zine-making workshop. The participants were given 10 minutes to elaborate on whatever a safe space meant to them, and the writings were stored to collectively be made into a zine that would be available at Sister Library's next event. After the zine workshop, the evening drew to a close with delectable treats and coffee, while the audience members engaged in lively conversation. The event left everyone with a full heart and a personal objective: to write more, and to write more freely.

Palahniuk, in his Armani water buffalo leather pants, leans forward, more than eager to elaborate, and starts recounting an event at Columbia University that took place during one of his readings: ""… This man falls backwards, falls forwards, falls on the floor, vomits, starts to aspirate his vomit, starts to bark like a dog while he's passed out, at that point, the publishing people come to the foot of the stage and they say, 'uh—Chuck? Over here. Do not read another word of this story, go right to Q&A, you've done enough damage.'"" The late-night crowd gasps predictably, and Conan wants to know what kind of stories is Palahniuk specifically reading that is causing this visceral reaction? And Palahniuk replies, ""It's a funny story about three ways that masturbation can go wrong."" The crowd keels with laughter this time. That is the story that started it all: ""Guts"". A short story included in his full-length 2005 novel, Haunted (Doubleday), which follows 17 aspiring writers responding to an advertisement of a secluded three-month writers' retreat. But Palahniuk was already performing live readings of this specific story, two full years before the book would come out, as part of his press tour for his other novel, Diary. An unexpected wave of fainting spells, vomiting episodes followed. As audience members bolted for the exits, and Palahniuk proudly tallied up these numbers as though he were racking up horror movie kills—it all culminated into something that read like Reddit creepypastas long before that had become a thing. It was marketing gold, a pure moment of viral horror before ""viral"" had also become a thing. Now, two decades later, the question lingers: Did ""Guts"" really cause waves of fainting spells, or did the legend grow legs of its own? ""Guts"" was actually formulated after one of Palahniuk's sessions at a support group for sex-addicts. Funnily, he wasn't there to collect material for Haunted, but Choke instead, a 2001 novel about a man who fakes choking in restaurants and attends similar support groups. But it was at one of these meetings where some of the personal stories shared were so extreme and graphic that it inspired him to collect similar tales for what would end up becoming this infamous short story.  20 years later, Haunted as a book, is remembered less for its themes of fame, exploitation and the cult of suffering, and more for whatever panic and puke-induced entrails ""Guts"" left behind. It really makes sense that Palahniuk was the author who needed to have paramedics on call during his live readings. ""Guts"" was one of the more gut-wrenching (pun fully intended) stories in Haunted, told in the deadpan confessional tone Palahniuk is famously known for. It is a twisted tale of self-pleasuring accidents gone grotesquely wrong—complete with pool drains, candle wax, and vegetables used in anatomically unapproved and deplorable ways. The book contained 23 short stories in total, all similarly grotesque in varying degrees, but few have reached infamy the same way ""Guts"" has, if at all. From crowded bookstores to crowded university auditoriums, Palahniuk watched as audience members dropped like flies. The count went from single to double digits, and ultimately reached legend status. And as word got around, it didn't take long for the skeptics to chime in: How much of it was manufactured? Some eyewitnesses from those tours talk about it being purely circumstantial—one lightheaded individual who couldn't handle the heat and the crowd, it just happened to be a Chuck Palahniuk reading where they blacked out. Some think it might have initially been one single person who didn't have the best reaction, and through word of mouth, in an age where the internet wasn't still as massively accessible, the whole ordeal must have turned into this horrible game of Chinese whisper, and as misinformation carried it must have turned into some kind of a group delusion. Besides, no one has ever contested that Palahniuk is a master when it comes to inducing queasiness, and the human body is extremely suggestible, after all. Now add in the theatrics of live readings and getting to meet one of your favorite authors, plus the anxiety of audience expectation, and a strange, subconscious urge to perform while everyone around you is whispering about some online posts from a fan forum where people had been boasting about surviving the ""Guts"" reading—you have a recipe for disaster. Whether that was 67 people or just six of them, people did faint, and they did throw up. In fact, remember the interview excerpt from before? If you are interested in a visual account, there is evidence of that. A 2003 documentary titled Postcards from the Future: The Chuck Palahniuk Documentary, which includes footage of a young man at Columbia University falling forwards and then backwards and then aspirating in his own vomit. And then there is the infamous Pitt News article by Jonathan Check, the University of Pittsburgh's daily student paper, where the author started his piece with the line: ""They came, they heard, they threw up"". In subsequent years, with the consequent rise of forums like Reddit and Palahniuk's personal (currently defunct) fan site, The Cult, it started to take the form of a dare—could you stomach ""Guts""? Readers had begun to challenge each other; wide-eyed hushes of previous body counts and a wave of shock that felt both like a personal high and a communal hug. The experience had become more about reacting to the reading and then sharing the reaction, in an age where book tours themselves have become less frequent. In the end we are left with some uncomfortable questions: considering how this was, after all, a marketing ploy—is it not just a tiny bit sleazy that it was built on legitimate audience trauma that got turned into an exaggerated narrative that was purely curated for buzz and sales? Why would Palahniuk keep doing it, until 67 people fainted and got sick? Why did his publishers allow this? Sure, Chuck has never shied away from provocation but doesn't something about this still feel a little nasty? But then again, some would argue that the audience demanded it, people showed up in droves desperate to throw up at the Chuck Palahniuk ""Guts"" reading and he was just appeasing his fans. Wasn't he? He just exposed the lengths of sensationalism, an era of people desperate to push boundaries. Weren't these the same groups of people lurking behind Ogrish.com and LiveLeak URLs, after all? I was too busy being three years old when the Pitt News article first came out. My acquaintance with ""Guts"" is fairly recent. I started the book in 2022, and it took me quite a while to get through all of it. That same year, ""Guts"" had a resurgence on BookTok and many videos of people ""live-reacting"" as they read the piece with flashy titles like: ""This has to be the grossest book I've ever read"". 20 years later, Haunted as a book, is remembered less for its themes of fame, exploitation and the cult of suffering, and more for whatever panic and puke-induced entrails ""Guts"" left behind. But considering the iconography of Chuck Palahniuk, especially in terms of provocation, somehow, the lasting legacy of ""Guts"" is rather fitting. 20 years later, the story of ""Guts"" seems to have carved out a peculiar niche in the pop-culture hall of fame for years to come.

Then it comes—the synchronised azzan, a digital decree broadcast from unseen speakers across Sonali Prantor, a gated community funded by the government for senior administrators. It reverberates through Rahim's chest like a low-frequency hum, too commanding to be sacred. He stands at the window, gazing at the pale sky, its glow filtered and artificial under the city's light-pollution shields. The dawn outside looks more like a simulation than a morning. He inhales deeply. The recycled air carries that familiar metallic tang, faint yet always present. ""Another day,"" he says aloud, though no one hears him. The walls, perfectly soundproofed, absorb his voice. ""Another brick in the edifice of stability."" At his minimalist desk, his fingers trace the smooth surface—uniform, unblemished. A government-issued datapad lights up with precision. Today's schedule reads: Design Review–Housing Block 7B. Ensure adherence to National Aesthetic Standard–Form 3. No deviation. No curve. No joy. His mind slips—just for a second—to the rickshaw rides of his youth in Old Dhaka: the clanging bells, the scent of jasmine fighting through diesel fumes, the vibrant noise of human life, spilling and spontaneous. Now, an automated metro-rail glides silently through the city. Conversations have become clipped, calculated. Efficiency replaces spontaneity. They call it peace. Rahim calls it absence. Inside The Walls of Conformity, the architectural firm where he works, the air is clean, temperature-regulated. The only sounds: the low hum of ventilation and the quiet tapping of compliant keystrokes. Sunlight filters through anti-glare windows, leaving pale, sterile shadows on the floors. Farzana leans over his shoulder. Her voice, like everything else here, is careful: ""Rahim bhai, the community center revisions must comply with the 'Unity in Structure' clause. No curved lines. The Minister was specific."" Rahim nods, eyes locked on the blueprint—another rigid, rectangular design he has drawn a hundred times before: ""Of course,"" he says. ""Unity."" Farzana hovers a second, unsure whether to say more. She doesn't. She walks away, and Rahim stares at the screen. ""Why does unity always have to be so… straight?"" he murmurs. The thought feels dangerous, rebellious. He lets it live for a few seconds longer. He almost sees it—the elegant arc he once dreamed of, a line that reached out and invited connection. He had sketched it once, years ago, before the guidelines tightened like a noose. That curve belongs now to the graveyard of unsanctioned ideas. During the mandated tea break, Rahim finds himself in the company lounge. On the screen, Janatar Alo plays: a polished newsreel showing smiling farmers, record yields, children learning under solar-powered domes. The Prime Minister's face hovers above it all, benevolent and unblinking. ""Such progress,"" says Mr. Kamal, the senior partner, his tone laced with government-certified admiration. ""Truly, we're living in golden times."" Rahim sips his tea. It's too sweet. Manufactured sweet. The aftertaste clings like something he didn't consent to. His eyes drift to a tiny crack running along the pristine white wall. Just a hairline fracture, almost invisible. But it's there—a reminder that even perfection has seams. At lunch, Rahim doesn't eat. Instead, he walks. Past the manicured courtyards, past the motion-sensing security drones, until he reaches the edge of the administrative complex—and then, beyond it. There, hidden and overlooked, lies an overgrown patch of earth. Wild grasses. Discarded leaves. Disorder. And a banyan tree. The aerial roots reach down like fingers remembering the soil. The leaves rustle in a breeze that feels unapproved, natural. Rahim places his palm on the bark. It's rough, ridged with time, unapologetic. He closes his eyes and breathes in. The scent of damp soil fills his lungs—a memory more than a smell, a touch of something ungoverned. He stays still until a sudden sound cuts through—laughter. A boy, no older than seven, darts through the undergrowth chasing a butterfly. His arms flail. His smile is crooked and wide. His joy is unscripted. Rahim watches him go, and a quiet smile finds its way to his face. Not the kind he wears in meetings. A real one. Unpractised. Soft. Later, he enters the old data archive. It is cool, dim, and nearly forgotten—a room preserved for the sake of memory, not function. The air smells of dust and magnetised plastic. He scans the interface and types: Artistic Expression–Unregulated Era. The screen blossoms with chaos. Murals spilling off concrete walls, barefoot dancers leaping mid-spin, poets reciting verses into crackling microphones. Unfiltered faces. Raw emotion. Rahim slows the recording. A poet reads with fire in his voice, metaphors rising like steam from boiling water. The cadence of resistance, not yet drowned by compromise. ""To feel so deeply…"" Rahim murmurs, eyes locked on the screen. ""To express without fear… what was that like?"" A quiet voice replies behind him: ""It was volatile. But it was alive."" He turns. An elderly librarian stands nearby. Her sari is faded but neatly pinned, her eyes gentle and sharp at once. ""Alive,"" Rahim repeats, as though testing the taste of the word. She nods. ""Stability asks a price, Architect. We pay with our color, our chaos, our contradictions."" For a moment, they simply look at one another. Then she walks away. At night, the government news beams across his wall screen—record highs, perfect cities, seamless unity. Rahim doesn't watch. He opens a drawer and takes out a sketchbook. Not a tablet. Not a sanctioned file. Paper. Rough around the edges, the cover curling with age.Inside are sketches from another version of himself: bold arches, scattered balconies, rooftops that curve like waves. Illicit lines. Human lines. He picks up a charcoal pencil. His hand trembles—not with fear, but with something older. Something that remembers. In the darkness behind his eyelids, he begins to draw: the banyan, the boy, the poet's face mid-verse. He draws not with permission but with memory. With hunger. The pages will remain hidden, unseen by the officials or committees. But within this secret act of creation, Rahim breathes. Outside, Sonali Prantor stays silent and flawless. But inside—inside him—something imperfect begins to stir. Haroonuzzamanis a Bangladeshi translator, novelist, poet, researcher, and essayist.

Here, I have taken on the (almost impossible!) task of selecting her top five favourite titles—the ones she insists on listening to and watching again and again, while still learning to read and write her ABCs. Children of Foreign Lands
 Elizabeth F. McCrady The Platt & Munk Co., Inc., 1936 This hardcover brings together an illustrated collection of stories of children from different parts of the world—Southeast Asia, Europe, and North and South America. This book is a foundational gateway to the wider world which encourages young minds to think beyond borders while embracing the universal joys of childhood. What struck me most was how many questions the book sparked in my five-year-old. She was curious, puzzled, and at times even a little surprised. Why do they wear those clothes? What are they doing? These unfamiliar details opened up opportunities for rich conversations about culture, difference, and acceptance. Esho Rongdhonu Banai Tariq Manzoor (writer) and Sarah Toufika (illustrator) Sesame Workshop Bangladesh, 2019 Esho Rongdhonu Banai is not only a colourful book about rainbows, but also features favourite Sisimpur characters demonstrating a fun scientific experiment to help children understand how the spectrum of colours blooms in a rainbow. One Last Try
 Shamim Ahmed Mayurpankhi, 2025 Inspired by Sri Lankan oral folk tales, Ahmed weaves a story about a hat seller and a troop of monkeys. The narrative strings together various elements into a unique interpretation, offering a fun, imaginative, and inspirational read. Jack and the Beanstalk Iona Treahy (writer) and Ruth Rivers (illustrator) Ladybird, 1999 This classic retelling of Jack and the Beanstalk offers more than just adventure. While my five-year-old was enchanted by the towering beanstalk and the magical golden harp, she also had questions—about stealing, about giants, and about fairness. These moments opened up conversations about right and wrong, bravery, and making choices. Tumi Jodi Akashe Takao
 Eylu Şeyrek Altass (writer), Abul Khair Mohammad Atiqur Rahman (translator), and Alexandra Fabia (illustrator) Mayurpankhi 2024 Saving the best (and my favourite) for last, Tumi Jodi Akashe Takao takes young readers across a celestial canvas. Each page of this book is a visual feast, with soft hues and pencil strokes bringing the night sky to life in detail. Reading this book with my daughter evoked a sense of tranquillity within us both. Not only did I fall in love with the artwork, but I fell head over heels in love with the prose. Kudos to Turkish authors and their creative inspiration!

https://www.thedailystar.net//books-literature/news/faria-basher-named-asia-regional-winner-commonwealth-short-story-prize-3894546,Faria Basher named Asia Regional Winner of Commonwealth Short Story Prize,https://www.thedailystar.net//books-literature/news/faria-basher-named-asia-regional-winner-commonwealth-short-story-prize-3894546,"Faria Basher, a writer from Bangladesh, has been announced as one of the five Regional Winners for this year's Commonwealth Short Story Prize. After being shortlisted for the award earlier this year for her story ""An Eye and a Leg"", Basher has become the first writer of Bangladeshi origin to win the Asian regional prize. The winning story, 'An Eye and a Leg', centres on an unmarried woman in her mid-thirties whose body begins to ""spontaneously disintegrate"". Alarmed, her parents turn to a doctor who advises them to take her to the ""Marriage Market"" in search of a cure. It is a surreal and darkly comic exploration of the trope of the ""expiring"" South Asian woman.  Basher, a 25-year-old writer drawn to the offbeat, the absurd, and the odd, said, ""Throughout time, I've seen how women across the world experience pressure and social conditioning to marry and bear children, and this is especially heightened in South Asian cultures, often dangerously so. I can't say I've been able to completely avoid it myself. Through my story, I really wanted to highlight how ridiculous it is when we say that a woman is 'past her prime', or 'losing value'. It's such an absurd way of thinking that I knew I had to use absurdism to tell this story, along with elements of the macabre, and of course, humour."" She was also appreciative of the prize itself, adding, ""I think that for many writing competitions, there's an unspoken requirement to tone down or dilute certain cultural contexts and themes. But for the Commonwealth Short Story Prize, I felt fully comfortable incorporating the South Asian thematic elements that my work required in order to be effective. These were crucial to the story I was telling and the message I was trying to get across.""  'An Eye and a Leg' juxtaposes societal expectations with those of an individual woman, delivering a massive punch from the very first lines. Quietly, without hysterics, without playing to victimhood, this satire, absurd and hilarious in turn, widens our awareness of the lack of agency for a woman, whoever she is. It is one of the best crafted stories I have read in the competition. Malaysian author Saras Manickam, who won the Asia regional prize in 2019 and served as this year's judge for the Asian region, remarked, ""However accomplished or educated (or even happy) she is, a woman is considered 'handicapped' if she is not married. On that societal premise, 'An Eye and a Leg' juxtaposes societal expectations with those of an individual woman, delivering a massive punch from the very first lines. Quietly, without hysterics, without playing to victimhood, this satire, absurd and hilarious in turn, widens our awareness of the lack of agency for a woman, whoever she is. It is one of the best crafted stories I have read in the competition."" The other regional winners are ""Mothers Not Appearing in Search"" by Joshua Lubwama from Uganda (Africa), ""Descend"" by Chanel Sutherland from Canada/Saint Vincent and the Grenadines (Canada & Europe), ""Margot's Run"" by Subraj Singh from Guyana (Caribbean), and ""Crab Sticks and Lobster Rolls"" Kathleen Ridgwell from Australia. The Chair of the Judges for this year's competition, award-winning writer and filmmaker, Professor Dr Vilsoni Hereniko, said in a congratulatory message, ""These stories illuminate many aspects of human nature and demonstrate true mastery of the short story form. Each tale shows that geography matters in storytelling. They are works of fiction that are inseparable from the local culture and history from which they have sprung. They have colour and emotional resonance—and they moved me deeply.""  The £5000 Commonwealth Short Story Prize is awarded annually by the Commonwealth Foundation for the best unpublished short story, ranging between 2,000 and 5,000 words, written by an author from a Commonwealth nation. Regional winners receive £2,500. The prize is open to anyone aged 18 or older, and entries are accepted in a wide range of languages, such as Bangla, Chinese, Creole, English, French, Greek, Malay, Maltese, Portuguese, Samoan, Swahili, Tamil, and Turkish. Submissions translated to English are also accepted. The winning stories are published online by Granta and in a special print collection by Paper+Ink. The overall winner for the Commonwealth Short Story Prize 2025 will be announced in an online ceremony on 25 June, 2025. নুসরাত ফারিয়াকে আজ মঙ্গলবার সকালে জামিন দেওয়া হয়।",2025-05-14T16:46:38+06:00
https://www.thedailystar.net//books-literature/news/tamadi-alap-exploring-the-space-between-sound-and-silence-3893846,‘Tamadi Alap’: Exploring the space between sound and silence,https://www.thedailystar.net//books-literature/news/tamadi-alap-exploring-the-space-between-sound-and-silence-3893846,"Has poetry become tamadi (irrelevant)? Is poetry dead? Or can it be dead? From the semantics of poems to the metaphysics of poetry—discussions addressing such questions took place in ""Tamadi Alap"", a poetry reading and discussion session on writer and poet Naseef Faruque Amin's poetry collection, Tamadi (Boitoroni, 2025). Jointly arranged by Ahmad Sofa Rashtroshobha and Centre for Asian Arts and Culture (CAAC), on May 11 at Planners Tower in the Banglamotor area of the capital, chief participants of the panel were the poet Naseef Amin, the writer and researcher Tahmidal Zami, and Professor Salimullah Khan.  The discussion was initiated with a short introduction of the poet by Tahmidal Zami, followed by a recitation of some of his poems by Amin, including ""Onortho"", ""Kotipoy Shironamhin Shunnota"", ""Jama Bebshaye"", ""Motadorsher Daga"", among others. The writer began with the confession that he was obsessed with words and language since childhood, and how words played and interacted with themselves. This never-ending fascination with words, their changing meanings, and their semantics was what led him to poetry.  The stage was then set for the first discussion by Zami—it was infused with the personal experiences he had with the poet and his poetry, and his rigorous literary analysis. He, too, read out some of the poems from the phase he identifies as the ""anti-lyric poetry phase"" of the poet. The poems contained satirical undertones, often mixed with vulgar expressions to critique the political and social establishment of his time, which he felt included the petty bourgeoisie, the intellectuals who didn't dare question power, and the ever-cautious urban middle class. Zami then descended into a much more detailed history of lyric and anti-lyric poetry as discussed by Walter Benjamin and other theorists. In the next part of the discussion, Zami discussed what he sees as the ""lyric poetry phase"" of the poet. Here, he saw a form of nostalgia for childhood, a form of love for childhood which recurs quite a few times, especially when talking about love and death. But the chief concern of the lyric poetry phase, he identified, was the poet's exploration of the phenomenon of how language fails. For Zami, this was the fundamental contradiction which the poet was trying to overcome—his unending love for words, but at the same time, the realisation that words cannot fully comprehend human existence. Finally, Professor Salimullah Khan took the stage to initiate discussion. He posited that the poet, to be remembered, needs to transcend that boundary between personal and collective. He gave an example of Baudelaire, who expressed the collective experiences of the modern urban life of 19th century Paris through his personal experience documented in poetry—the rush, the alienation, and the breakdown of interpersonal relationships between strangers. He praised Amin for this particular reason: his poetry surpassed the personal experiences of his suffering in maintaining the work-life balance and became a collective manifesto for everyone living the modern 21st-century urban life. Khan finished his discussion with a short answer to the question at the beginning: Can poetry die? His answer: ""Never."" As long as there is language, he said, poetry would prevail. Through this bold proclamation, the event came to an end. Sadman Ahmed Siam, as the name suggests, is indeed a sad man.

https://www.thedailystar.net//books-literature/news/motherhood-and-mahasweta-devis-breast-giver-3892376,On motherhood and Mahasweta Devi’s ‘Breast-Giver’,https://www.thedailystar.net//books-literature/news/motherhood-and-mahasweta-devis-breast-giver-3892376,"For all the joys and agonies of motherhood, Jashoda did not flinch from suckling 50 children. It caught on to her though, the breast cancer, and perhaps more emphatically, the social alienation with which she is met—all this after being revered as the ""Lionseated"" incarnate, that is to say, Durga (the Mother Goddess in Hindu mythology) for suckling, as a wet-nurse, 30 children who were not her own. ""When a mortal masquerades as God here below, she is forsaken by all and she must always die alone"", so the story, ""Stanadayini"" (""Breast-Giver"", 1980) by Mahasweta Devi goes. The short story is a critical imagination of motherhood—an exploration of the dynamics of oppression within which motherhood is so often embedded, particularly in the South Asian subcontinent.  Born in Dhaka, Devi (1926-2016) was a leading contemporary writer in Bangla, known as much for her political activism and grassroots work among marginalised communities of Bengal and Bihar. As for her fiction—also tinged with similar socio-political critique, and garbed in her distinctly direct yet subtle voice—roars themes of struggle and resistance in a way that somehow never feels ideologically heavy-handed. ""Breast-Giver"" narrates the struggles of a ""professional mother,"" Jashoda, a Brahmin woman driven to make ends meet by serving as a wet-nurse for the wealthy Haldar-household after an accident leaves her husband crippled. The men of the household, as well as the Mistress who runs it, acquiesce to Jashoda's role so that their own women could ""keep their bodies"" while breeding yearly as Jashoda bears the brunt of suckling their children. As a result, ""Jashoda doesn't remember at all when there was no child in her womb."" She feels empty ""without a child at the breast. Motherhood is a great addiction."" While Margaret Atwood's exemplary novel of Western feminism, The Handmaid's Tale (1985), imagines the woman's body being reduced to a breeding-vessel as a dystopia, ""Breast-Giver"" portrays how that is more of a reality than dystopia for many women in South Asia. Jashoda's extraordinary ""mammal projections"" and ""capacious breasts"" soon become objects of envy for the Haldar-household and bread-winners for her own. The part of her body, symbolically heavy with connotations of womanhood is never sexualised, rather, constantly doused in the nectar of motherhood. This, however, is no bittersweet, humane form of motherhood—but motherhood stripped to its most primitive, (concurrently glorified) biological form, as exemplified by terms such as ""mammal projections"" and analogies likening Jashoda to the divine ""Cow of Fulfillment"" of the Hindu legends. As translator Gayatri Spivak has pointed out with regard to the significance of the story's title, the author ""deliberately foregrounds the centrality of the female body in Jashoda's transactions with her clients—she is not just a 'wet-nurse,' a provider of milk, but a 'breast-giver.'"" This distinction is amplified by the grim irony that ensues—she has literally given away her breasts when her body rots and putrefies at the clasp of breast cancer. Traditional female values such as unreasoning devotion and selflessness, all embodied by Jashoda, are thus undermined as ""the self-destructive task of being mother of the world"" unfolds in the course of the narrative.  In her delusions and death-throes, Jashoda mistakes everyone for her children: ""The doctor who sees her everyday...the untouchable who will put her in the furnace, are all her milk-sons."" This again merges with divine icons of motherhood such as mother of the universe, Shakti. Jashoda herself is named for Yashoda, the mother of the beloved cowherd-child-god Krishna. These mythic allusions interweaved within the narrative, coupled with the deceptively realistic, unsentimental, matter-of-fact tone in which the tale is told, make for an enthralling concoction. At the same time, the author's scathing satire makes you laugh at the follies of characters who are representatives of a society that we are all too familiar with. Devi's critique is sharp against not only the colluding forces of patriarchy and capitalism in the exploitation of the disadvantaged but also other issues entrenched in Indian society such as caste-based discrimination, provincialism, the remnants of British colonialism, and so on. Reading ""Breast-Giver,"" I couldn't help but think of the cultural significance of the word ""ma"" in our own society today; it is lead-heavy with meaning and so frequently invoked—from commonplace addresses of tender respect for women (think of the doctor who addresses you as ma) to motherly depictions of the landscape of Bengal in artworks, songs, and films. Moreover, ""Breast-Giver"" not only underlines the socio-religious significance of motherhood in Indian society, but also the peculiar psycho-social significance—with which we may be more familiar. For example, consider the lines: ""Her [Jashoda's] mother-love wells up for Kangali as much as for her children. She wants to become the earth and feed her crippled husband and helpless children…Sages did not write of this motherly feeling of Jashoda's for her husband…Such is the power of the Indian soil that all women turn into mothers here and all men remain immersed in the spirit of holy childhood.""   The narrator then highlights the hypocrisy of educated, liberal-minded men who deny this phenomenon ""to the effect of the 'eternal she'—'Simone de Beauvoir,' et cetera"": ""It is notable that the educated Babus desire all this [only] from women outside the home"" but, inside the home, ""they want the Divine Mother in the words and conduct of the revolutionary ladies. The process is most complicated."" The narrator seals this critique with tongue-in-cheek that made me giggle: ""Because he understood this [""process""] the heroines of Saratchandra always fed the hero an extra mouthful of rice."" Saratchandra precisely catered to that elite strata of liberal male readership. Moreover, the classic trope of the wife feeding the husband rice, as a depiction of the epitome of romance, similarly runs rampant in Bengali and Bollywood films. This odd mouth-feeding fetish appears embedded within the collective psyche of our society, much like the ""belly-centered consciousness"" of Jashoda's husband. ""Jashoda's death was also the death of God,"" the story ends. I read this line as a reference to the passing of the old order and the arrival of the new, with the new Haldar daughters and granddaughters refusing to have children. Notably, Jashoda becomes all the more alienated after these in-laws start moving out and the traditional family thus breaks apart.  At the same time, ""Breast-Giver"" seems a prefiguration of and an affirmative nod to American intersectional feminist Audre Lorde's famous statements: ""the master's tools will never dismantle the master's house. They may allow us temporarily to beat him at his own game, but they will never enable us to bring about genuine change. And this fact is only threatening to those women [like Jashoda] who still define the master's house as their only source of support."" Gender norms are upturned in the story: the husband cooks and the wife works, yet the status of wage-earner does not liberate Jashoda because she relies on the ""master's"" idea of motherhood for support. Finally, seeing her decaying body, her own people stop visiting her at the hospital. To them, ""Mother meant hair in a huge topknot, blindingly white clothes, a strong personality. The person lying in the hospital is someone else, not Mother."" What does mother mean to us and how rigid or fluid is our idea of motherhood? Syeda Fatema Rahman is a writer from Dhaka, Bangladesh.

The convict, Jitu Mia, had long been occupying the government land, said officials. Upazila Assistant Commissioner (Land) and Executive Magistrate Shah Zahurul Hossain led the drive and handed down the sentence on the spot. Speaking to The Daily Star, the executive magistrate said, ""Such activities not only violate the law but also pose serious threats to the environment. Our drives against illegal occupation of government land and environmentally harmful practices will continue."" The action was taken following complaints that Jitu Mia had been flattening a hill and erecting a structure on the khas land, he added. নুসরাত ফারিয়াকে আজ মঙ্গলবার সকালে জামিন দেওয়া হয়।",2025-05-19T00:34:13+06:00

Pillars of the four-storey structure have developed cracks, with rusted rods getting exposed and plaster regularly falling off from the ceiling and columns. The building shakes whenever heavy vehicles pass along the adjacent road. Locals fear that the building might collapse at any moment. The structure, located beside Latachapli Government Primary School, puts hundreds of schoolchildren at constant risk a major hazard. Students, teachers, and residents are demanding its immediate demolition and construction of a new cyclone centre more equipped to cater to their need. According to the LGED's Kalapara upazila office, the building was officially declared abandoned in 2023 due to its poor condition. Aung Talukder, president of Rakhaine Buddhist Welfare Association and a resident of Kuakata's Keranipara, said the land was donated by his late father, Baching Talukder for construction of the building in 1974–75 to function as both a cyclone shelter and a primary school. Later, in 1998, LGED converted it into a rest house, he said. There is now a separate one-storey primary school building just east of the structure, along with a field used by children for playing, and a road adjacent to it. The old, crumbling building, however, remains a threat to anyone using the area. Md Nazrul Islam, headteacher of the school, said, ""Around 400 students are enrolled here. This risky structure lies abandoned on the playground for past 7-8 years. We've warned the students to stay away from it, and even the playground is now off-limits to them. We've reported the issue to LGED multiple times, but they have yet to take steps to demolish it."" Trijon Gayali, a fifth-grader, said, ""The building may collapse any time. We're scared to play in the field beside. It must be removed before it is too late."" Motaleb Sharif, president of the Kuakata Hotel-Motel Owners' Association, said the dilapidated building stands beside the main paved road leading to the sea beach, thereby posing risk to both tourists and locals. Mohammad Yasin Sadek, Kuakata Municipality administrator and assistant commissioner (land), said he had discussed the matter with the upazila engineer of LGED. ""The issue will be raised at the next monthly upazila meeting for urgent action,"" he added. Mohammad Sadekur Rahman, upazila engineer of LGED in Kalapara, said a proposal for the building's demolition has been already sent to the executive engineer's office. ""Once the process is complete, we will demolish the structure as soon as possible, and necessary steps will be taken to construct a new building at the site"" he said. নুসরাত ফারিয়াকে আজ মঙ্গলবার সকালে জামিন দেওয়া হয়।",2025-05-18T21:06:40+06:00

The plant was installed in a salinity-prone region where potable water has long been scarce. Implemented jointly by Good Neighbors Bangladesh, a local NGO, and the Embassy of Japan, the facility is capable of supplying an average of 20,000 litres of purified water daily. Khan Nanami, adviser of the ""Grant Assistance for Grassroots Human Security Projects (GGP)"" at the Japanese embassy, inaugurated the plant. Following the inauguration, a discussion was held at the upazila parishad, chaired by Ishaq Maji, president of Safe Water Committee (SWC), a local beneficiary group. Taltali upazila nirbahi officer Umme Salma attended as chief guest. Good Neighbors Bangladesh managing director Bartin Gomez was also present among others. Speakers said salinity levels in the coastal areas have risen significantly since the Cyclone Aila in 2009, destroying natural sources of drinkable water and exposing local residents — especially women and children — to serious health risks. The newly installed plant will provide a sustainable daily supply of clean water, which has been tested and verified as safe for both drinking and cooking. To ensure uninterrupted access during floods, 12 'safe water points' have also been installed in elevated areas. A locally formed Safe Drinking Water Management Committee will be overseeing the plant's operations and maintenance. Stakeholders said the project contributes directly to achieving Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 6 by ensuring availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all. নুসরাত ফারিয়াকে আজ মঙ্গলবার সকালে জামিন দেওয়া হয়।",2025-05-18T19:20:36+06:00
