https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/12/31/thousands-march-in-bangladesh-calling-for-prosecution-of-overthrown-pm,12/31/2024,"Thousands of people have rallied in Bangladesh’s capital to demand the prosecution of ousted Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and those responsible for hundreds of deaths in a mass uprising against her government in July. The Anti-Discrimination Student Movement organised what it called the March for Unity on Tuesday at the Central Shaheed Minar, a national monument in Dhaka. Protesters chanted slogans calling for Hasina’s trial and the banning of her Awami League party.     Hasina fled to India on August 5 after weeks of violence in which authorities said hundreds of people were killed and thousands more injured on the orders of her government. The uprising ended the 15-year rule of the country’s longest-serving prime minister, who began a fourth consecutive term in January after elections boycotted by opposition parties. Last week, Bangladesh sent a formal request to India to extradite Hasina. She faces many court cases over the deaths of protesters, including some on charges of crimes against humanity. “Since August 5, we have no more enemies in Bangladesh. Our only enemy is the Awami League,” Hasnat Abdullah, convener of the student movement, said while addressing the crowd.    Protesters also urged the interim government headed by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus to issue a formal proclamation by January 15 representing the uprising. The student leaders want the proclamation to include two key demands: a new constitution after the abolishment of the current charter, which was enacted under Hasina’s father in 1972, and a ban on the Awami League. Hasina’s party had ruled Bangladesh since 2009. The Dhaka-based International Crimes Tribunal has already issued arrest warrants for Hasina and her close aides, and the government has sought help from the international police organisation Interpol in seeking her arrest. Speaking from the United States, Hasina’s son, Sajeeb Wazed, has questioned the credibility of the tribunal and called charges against her a “political witch-hunt”. Meanwhile, the interim government has promised to try Hasina and others in her administration on charges involving the deaths of protesters and has invited the United Nations to help investigate the killings. Hasina has also called for an investigation, saying many deaths may have involved other parties aside from the security agencies.",2024,12
https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/12/26/bangladesh-to-investigate-2009-paramilitary-mutiny-massacre,12/26/2024,"Bangladesh has ordered a commission to investigate a failed 2009 paramilitary mutiny and subsequent crackdown, including the role of alleged “foreign” backers, the inquiry chief said. The mutineers stole thousands of weapons from the headquarters of the Bangladesh Rifles (BDR) paramilitary force before embarking on a killing spree in the barracks in February 2009.     The uprising quickly spread, with thousands of soldiers seizing weapons and pledging allegiance to the mutineers. The army crushed the mutiny, leaving 74 dead, including 57 army officials. Hundreds of soldiers were handed punishments by special military courts, ranging from death to a few years in prison, with the United Nations criticising the process for failing to meet basic standards. The violent mutiny sent shockwaves through the South Asian nation. A previous official investigation blamed years of pent-up anger among soldiers, who felt their appeals for pay rises and better treatment were ignored. But that probe was carried out during the tenure of Sheikh Hasina, who was removed as prime minister by a revolution in August, when she fled to old ally India. Since her fall, families of soldiers killed in the violence have been campaigning to reopen the investigation. They have repeatedly accused Hasina – then newly elected – of orchestrating a plan to weaken the military to bolster her own power in a country prone to coups. Protesters have also alleged India’s involvement in that plot. The claims are likely to infuriate New Delhi, which did not immediately respond to the allegations. “We aim to determine whether any foreign entity was involved in the carnage, as allegations of national and international conspiracy have been raised,” commission chief A L M Fazlur Rahman told reporters on Thursday. Hasina’s iron-fisted rule was allegedly backed by New Delhi, and the 77-year-old remains in India, adding to fraying relations between the two nations. On Monday, Dhaka said it had requested India send Hasina back to face charges of “massacres, killings, and crimes against humanity”.",2024,12
https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/12/23/bangladesh-tells-india-it-wants-ex-pm-hasina-back-for-judicial-process,12/23/2024,"Bangladesh has told India it wants former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, who fled to New Delhi in August, back in the country for “judicial process”, says the acting head of the country’s foreign ministry. “We sent a note verbale to the Indian government saying that the Bangladesh government wants her [Hasina] back here for judicial process,” Touhid Hossain told reporters on Monday, referring to diplomatic correspondence between the two countries.     Hossain did not elaborate on the judicial process. “We confirm that we have received a note verbale from the Bangladesh High Commission today in connection with an extradition request. At this time, we have no comment to offer on this matter,” the official spokesperson of India’s Ministry of External Affairs said. Ties between the South Asian neighbours, who have strong trade and cultural links, have become fraught since Hasina was deposed following violent protests against her rule and she took refuge across the border. The head of Bangladesh’s interim government, Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus, has demanded that India send Hasina back so that Bangladesh can try her for what it says are crimes against protesters and her opponents, and crimes she is accused of committing during her tenure over the past 15 years. Yunus has also been upset with Hasina for criticising his administration from New Delhi.    Dhaka’s request to New Delhi came two weeks after India’s foreign secretary visited Bangladesh and the two countries said they hoped to mend relations. Hasina faces numerous charges, including crimes against humanity, genocide, and murder, among others, all of which she has denied. Dozens of Hasina’s allies have been taken into custody since her regime collapsed in August, accused of involvement in a police crackdown that killed more than 750 people, mostly youth, during the unrest that led to her removal. Hasina has also called for an investigation into the killings, saying many deaths may have involved others beyond security agencies. The Dhaka-based International Crimes Tribunal has issued arrest warrants for Hasina and her close aides, and the government has sought help from the international police organisation Interpol for her arrest. Separately, Bangladesh on Monday launched a probe into the alleged embezzlement of $5bn, connected to a Russian-backed nuclear power plant – the Rooppur nuclear plant, by Hasina and her family, the country’s anticorruption commission said. “The claims of kickbacks, mismanagement, money laundering, and potential abuse of power raise significant concerns about the integrity of the project and the use of public funds,” the commission said.

https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/12/16/bangladesh-plans-to-hold-elections-in-late-2025-or-early-2026,12/16/2024,"General elections in Bangladesh will be held in late 2025 or early 2026, the country’s interim leader Muhammad Yunus, who heads the caretaker government installed after a popular revolution in August, announced. “Election dates could be fixed by the end of 2025 or the first half of 2026,” the Nobel Peace Prize-winning leader said in a national broadcast on Monday delivered on the 53rd anniversary of Bangladesh winning independence.     Pressure has been growing on Yunus, appointed the country’s “chief adviser” after the student-led uprising that toppled ex-premier Sheikh Hasina, to set a date for elections. Bangladesh’s army chief General Waker-uz-Zaman, whose refusal to support Hasina during the deadly student protests led to her departure, said in September that democracy should be restored within 12 to 18 months. Opposition parties including the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), one of two dominant parties in the country alongside the Awami League, have also called for elections to be held as soon as possible. Yunus has launched commissions to oversee a group of reforms he says are needed, and setting an election date depends on what political parties agree to. “Throughout, I have emphasised that reforms should take place first before the arrangements for an election,” he said. “If the political parties agree to hold the election on an earlier date with minimum reforms, such as having a flawless voter list, the election could be held … by the end of 2025,” he added. But including the full list of electoral reforms would delay polls by a few months, he said.    The 84-year-old microfinance pioneer is leading a temporary administration to tackle what he has called the “extremely tough” challenge of restoring democratic institutions in the South Asian nation of about 170 million people following Hasina’s removal. Hasina, 77, fled by helicopter to neighbouring India on August 5 as thousands of protesters stormed the prime minister’s palace in Dhaka. Hundreds of people were killed in the weeks prior to Hasina’s removal, most by police gunfire. Dozens more died in the hours after her toppling, largely in reprisal killings against prominent supporters of her Awami League party. Her government was also accused of politicising courts and the civil service, as well as staging lopsided elections, to dismantle democratic checks on its power during 14 years in power. Key among the reforms Yunus is pushing is an updated voter list, a “complex” challenge after years of turbulent democratic processes, requiring both the stripping of false names from lists and the registration of first-time voters in a rapidly growing youth population. Yunus said he dreamed of “ensuring 100 percent voter turnout” in polls. “If this can be achieved, no government will ever dare to strip citizens of their voting rights again,” he said. Bangladesh last held general elections in January when Hasina celebrated victory, a poll denounced as neither free nor fair and boycotted by rivals after a crackdown during which thousands of opposition party members were arrested. Yunus has said his administration is also focused on ensuring those guilty of abuses during the past government’s term face justice, including issuing a warrant for Hasina’s arrest.",2024,12
https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2024/12/12/our-lives-dont-matter-in-post-hasina-bangladesh-hindus-fear-future,12/12/2024,"Dhaka, Bangladesh – Krishna Das had never imagined that his peaceful life in Sunamganj, a northeastern district of Bangladesh, would come crashing down on a seemingly ordinary Tuesday evening last week. The trigger was an allegation of blasphemy. A young Hindu man, Akash Das, had allegedly posted an insulting comment about the Quran on Facebook. The comment quickly spread across social media, igniting protests and escalating tensions, particularly in the predominantly Muslim community of Dowarabazar, about 270km (168 miles) from the national capital Dhaka.     Krishna was at home when the first signs of chaos reached his doorstep in Monglargaon village about 8pm. “I heard shouting coming from the market,” Krishna recalled. “I couldn’t understand what was happening, but I could feel something was wrong.” Stepping outside, he saw people gathering in the streets, chanting slogans. Soon, the crowd grew into a mob, waving sticks and batons. “I rushed inside, locked the doors, and tried to hide,” he said. “But they broke in anyway.” The violence spread quickly, even though Akash Das, the 17-year-old Hindu man from his neighbourhood, had already been arrested by the police under the “cyber security act” before the mob descended on Monglargaon. “They destroyed everything – everything I had worked for. It was as if we were nothing – our lives didn’t matter,” Krishna, a small-scale farmer, told Al Jazeera. “They smashed our windows, destroyed our furniture, and began looting everything of value. They took money, little jewellery and anything they could find. Even the kitchen utensils.” The attackers even set fire to part of his house. Though Krishna was able to extinguish the flames, the family’s tin-roofed and walled home was destroyed, their possessions gone – and their sense of security shattered. When Al Jazeera met Krishna four days after the incident, his family – a wife and two teenage sons – was not at home. “I sent my wife and sons away to stay with relatives in the city,” Krishna told us in an exhausted voice. “They were terrified.” At least 20 other Hindu homes in Monglargaon were also attacked. “When they attacked my home, my two daughters and wife fled through the backdoor into the jungle,” said Bijon Das, referring to a dense patch of trees behind his house. “I have sent my daughters and wife to my relative’s house in the city [Sylhet, the nearest big city],” he added, saying that several Hindu men were staying back only to guard their homes. The mob violence lasted for about three to four hours before security forces intervened. “I saw that most of the damage was to tin-roofed houses and tin-shuttered shops,” said local journalist AR Jewel, who was on the scene when the attack happened, estimating about 20 properties were affected. However, Meher Nigar Tanu, the top bureaucrat for the subdistrict in which Monglargaon falls, downplayed the scale of the violence, arguing that “only a few homes and shops had been slightly damaged”. She insisted that some social media reports had “exaggerated” the violence, and told Al Jazeera that law enforcement officials had managed to stop a mob from entering a temple belonging to the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON), a Hindu religious movement. Local authorities, including the army and police, are working to restore a “sense of security” for the region’s Hindus, Tanu said. Still, fear lingers. In Monglargaon, the village at the heart of the violence, many houses were seen locked last week on Friday morning, and the streets were eerily quiet – with security forces stationed at street intersections. For many Hindus across Bangladesh, Monglargaon is a microcosm of the community’s deep insecurities these days. On August 5, then Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina fled hastily from Dhaka for India on a military aircraft after 15 years in power, following a popular uprising against her increasingly authoritarian rule. More than 1,000 people are estimated to have been killed in the crackdown by her security forces before she resigned. India is widely perceived in Bangladesh as having propped up Hasina’s rule. Hasina and her secular Awami League party, in turn, are viewed as having been more sympathetic to the country’s Hindu minority – which makes up 10 percent of the population – than the nation’s other major political forces, such as the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) and the Jamaat-e-Islami. Activists from the BNP and Jamaat – which both faced severe curbs under Hasina’s rule – no longer face those restrictions. Reports from the aftermath of the Hasina regime’s collapse suggest large-scale looting and the ransacking of national monuments and government buildings. More than 200 people were killed, across religions, mostly Awami League activists and police officials, as Hasina’s fall precipitated a thirst for retribution and revenge. According to the Bangladesh Hindu Buddhist Christian Unity Council (BHBCUC), a minority rights group, there were 2,000 incidents of “communal violence”, including nine Hindu deaths and 69 attacks on places of worship, between August 4 and August 20. However, investigations by Netra News, an independent investigative outlet, which scrutinised the most severe claims, the deaths of the nine Hindu men, found that the killings were “politically and personally motivated, not religiously driven”. Meanwhile, as relations between India and Bangladesh plummeted, some media reports in India exaggerated the scale of violence against Hindus. “In Bangladesh, attacks on minority groups have become common when transition in power occurs,” said 42-year-old Deboraj Bhattacharjee, a Hindu banker in Dhaka. “But the way some particular Indian media, aligned with BJP, are twisting the ground reality and spreading a climate of fear doesn’t help us here.” He was referring to India’s ruling Hindu majoritarian Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. As many as 49 Indian media outlets disseminated at least 13 false reports about Bangladesh between August 12 and December 5, 2024, according to an investigation by Rumor Scanner, an independent Bangladeshi fact-checking organisation. Still, “since the fall of Hasina, there is no way to deny the fear and insecurity that’s gripping the Hindu communities … mostly in rural areas,” said Bhattacharjee. Anti-Hindu religious activists, “who couldn’t dominate much during the Hasina rule, now are in strength”, he added. Abhro Shome Pias, a 27-year-old Hindu student who studies at Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET), Dhaka’s premier engineering college, said there had been “countless incidents of violence and persecution of Hindus”. “Many Hindus have been displaced, and their lands were grabbed forcibly, and it’s unclear whether they’ve received justice or compensation,” said Pias. The attacks also shine a light on a painful truth for many Bangladeshi Hindus: They say they need to constantly prove their loyalty to their country over India. “India is home to 90 percent of our religious sites, and that’s where our connection lies,” Pias explained. “However, the majority of Bangladeshi Hindus do not support the current Indian government or its ‘Hindutva’ extremism,” he said, referring to the Hindu majoritarian ideology of the BJP. That pressure to dissociate from India gets complicated when the giant neighbour is seen as peddling amplified accounts of atrocities against Hindus in Bangladesh, say community members. “Hindus in Bangladesh are facing a twofold problem,” said Chakravarty, a 29-year-old pharmacy owner at Dowarabazar market, who spoke on condition that his full name not be revealed. “On one hand, Indian media spreads disinformation and exaggerates incidents, some of which never even happened. This fuels anti-India sentiment, which, in turn, contributes to a feeling of insecurity among us, the Hindus.” It’s an insecurity Chakravarty lived through – and barely survived – last week. As the mob rampaged through Dowarabazar market last week, Chakravarty found himself trapped inside his shop, thinking only of his three-year-old daughter. His wife had passed away during the COVID-19 pandemic, and his daughter’s safety was his sole concern. “I was inside when I heard them chanting slogans. As they attacked, I quickly put the shutter down,” Chakravarty told Al Jazeera. “I was trapped inside for about two and a half hours while they attacked my shop and others nearby.” The attackers used machetes, threw bricks, and wreaked havoc on nearby businesses. “They couldn’t enter my pharmacy, but damaged my gates,” he said, adding that his uncle’s pharmacy in the same market was completely ransacked. “There wasn’t even a paracetamol left.” From inside his pharmacy, Chakravarty’s mind raced back home. “I kept calling my family, wondering if our house was attacked,” he said. His elderly mother, father and sister-in-law are now staying with his brother in Sylhet city, and his daughter is with them. “If it weren’t for my motherless daughter, I don’t know if I would have survived. I would have had a cardiac arrest,” he said, his voice cracking with emotion. “If they had gotten inside, they might have beaten me to death.” However, there were no reported injuries or casualties in the attack on the market that day. “Later that night, I came home and found the door broken, and everything – furniture, clothes – was destroyed. They even ransacked our drawers. In the morning, there was nothing left in the house to use,” he said. Some other families whose homes had been attacked had been left without even “utensils to cook their meal the next morning”, he said. Chakravarty, who also provides basic medical treatment door-to-door in nearby villages, said when he visited patients, he “saw disbelief in their eyes”. “The debris, the broken bits of furniture, bricks, and broken glasses all around the premises,” he recounted. Yet, Chakravarty emphasised that such violence was unprecedented in the region. “People here work together – even celebrate together in religious festivals and gatherings. This has never happened before,” he noted. “This will leave a scar for a long time.” The interim leadership in Bangladesh, led by 84-year-old Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus, has accused the Indian media of exaggerating attacks on Hindus in Bangladesh. Shafiqul Alam, press secretary to Yunus, acknowledged to Al Jazeera that there had been some attacks on religious minorities following the ousting of Hasina. But, he added, “many of the events reported in the Indian media have been exaggerated and part of an industrial level dissemination of deliberate disinformation”. The interim government is committed to upholding “freedom of religion, freedom of association, and freedom of assembly for all religious institutions”, he said. Calling on the religious leaders from all faiths for a “national unity” on Thursday last week, Yunus said there was a “discrepancy between the reality and the news published by foreign media”, about attacks on religious minorities. Meanwhile, Hindu activists have staged several large-scale protest rallies in the capital, Dhaka, and elsewhere since August to demand, among other things, laws to protect minorities, the establishment of a minority ministry, and a tribunal to prosecute acts of oppression against them. They also called for a five-day holiday for the biggest festival for Hindu Bengalis, Durga Puja. But tensions escalated further after the arrest of Chinmoy Krishna Das, a Hindu monk formerly associated with ISKCON, in November. Das had been rallying protests after Hasina’s removal. He was detained under a colonial-era sedition law after a local politician accused him of insulting the Bangladeshi flag by raising a saffron flag (commonly associated with Hinduism) on top of it at a rally calling for an end to the violence against Hindus. His arrest and subsequent bail denial triggered a wave of protests, culminating in a deadly clash with police when a Muslim lawyer was hacked to death outside a Chattogram court, allegedly by the supporters of ISKCON. Police arrested more than 20 individuals in connection with the murder, amid protests by lawyers and students who called for a ban on ISKCON in Bangladesh. The Supreme Court has so far rejected legal petitions seeking to ban ISKCON. Meanwhile, Hasina issued a statement from exile in India last week, accusing Yunus of failing to protect Hindus and other minorities. “Hindus, Buddhists, Christians – no one has been spared. Eleven churches have been destroyed. Temples and Buddhist shrines have been broken. When the Hindus protested, the ISKCON leader was arrested,” Hasina said. Yet, some Hindus argue that the notion that the community was safer in Bangladesh under Hasina is misplaced. Bhattacharjee recalls losing two acres (about 0.8 hectares) of family land at the hands of activists of a former Awami League MP, who was arrested last September on charges of “extortion and death threats”. “Hindus were not safe under Hasina either,” he said. “We were used as political pawns. The sense of security many Hindus felt during the Awami League regime was more psychological than real.” However, Sreeradha Datta, a professor and Bangladesh expert at Jindal School of International Affairs on the outskirts of New Delhi, India, explained to Al Jazeera that the perception of Hindu safety under a Hasina administration is rooted in historical context. “While violence against Hindus did occur during the Awami League’s 15-year rule, the party’s secular stance generally gave minority groups a sense of security and safety,” Datta said. “In contrast, during previous non-Awami League governments, like the BNP-Jamaat alliance, attacks on minorities notably increased. This continues to influence the current perceptions.” The minority rights group, BHBCUC, had earlier reported 45 murders, mostly of Hindus, between June 2023 and July 2024 during the Hasina administration. A prominent human rights group, Ain o Salish Kendra, reported at least 3,679 attacks on the Hindu community between January 2013 and September 2021, including vandalism, arson, and targeted violence, with Awami League leaders allegedly complicit in several cases. In 2021, following mob attacks on Hindu minority households and temples in Bangladesh during and after Durga Puja, rights group Amnesty International said, “Such repeated attacks against individuals, communal violence and destruction of the homes and places of worship of minorities in Bangladesh over the years show that the state has failed in its duty to protect minorities.” Manindra Kumar Nath, president of the BHBCUC, stressed that the minority movement in Bangladesh is distinct and independent from both India and Sheikh Hasina’s Awami League. “It’s not a new phenomenon. The demand for a minority protection law and the establishment of a minority commission has been longstanding,” he told Al Jazeera. Nath also noted that Hindu students were actively involved in the protest movement that led to the removal of Hasina’s government. “They united to protest the unfulfilled promises and demands that Hasina has ignored for far too long,” he explained. Khalid Mahmud Chowdhury, a former minister in Hasina’s cabinet now in exile in India, however, defended his party’s track record. “If you compare the violence against Hindus during non-[Awami League] regimes with what occurred under ours, the difference is clear,” he told Al Jazeera. “Some attacks did happen during our rule, we cannot deny that. However, what’s happening after August 5 is sheer brutality and a violation of human rights,” he added. “They [the interim government] are trying to remove secularism from the constitution.” The country’s constitution designates Islam as the state religion while also recognising “secularism” as one of the guiding principles. However, this may now be at risk of change. Bangladesh’s attorney general, Md Asaduzzaman, suggested during an October high court hearing that he would support the removal of secularism from the constitution. “Socialism and secularism do not reflect the realities of a nation where 90 percent of the population are Muslim,” he said. Nath warned that removing secularism from the constitution would significantly threaten the rights of religious minorities. “In the past, governments have promised us protections and rights in their election manifestos, but once in power, they failed to implement them,” he said. Bhattacharjee echoed those concerns. “If secularism is taken out of the constitution, it’ll send a clear message that religious minorities no longer matter to the state.” Already, he said, the government was downplaying attacks on Hindus, by suggesting that only those affiliated with the Awami League had been targeted and that the attackers were “miscreants” rather than mobs driven by sentiments against the community. “The real challenge for this interim government isn’t about combating disinformation from some other country,” he said. “It’s how they handle the rising violence at home, especially with fundamentalist groups now emboldened. The focus needs to be on ensuring Hindu minorities feel safe again.” “Words aren’t enough any more.”",2024,12
https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/12/5/bangladesh-mission-in-india-attacked-why-are-ties-in-freefall,12/5/2024,"India-Bangladesh ties have been frosty since former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina fled to India after her removal in a student-led mass uprising in August, but diplomatic tensions have soared in recent days after the two South Asian neighbours traded accusations of alleged ill-treatment of the Hindu minority. The war of words escalated after Bangladeshi authorities arrested Hindu religious leader Chinmoy Krishna Das last week on sedition charges, setting off protests across several places in India. On Monday, a Bangladeshi mission in Agartala in the northeast Indian state of Tripura was attacked, eliciting a furious reaction from Dhaka.     A day later, Dhaka summoned the Indian envoy in Bangladesh after condemning the attack. “This particular act in Agartala stands in violation of the inviolability of diplomatic missions, as the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, 1961, asks for,” Bangladesh’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said, calling on the Indian government to investigate the incident. New Delhi said the attack was “deeply regrettable”. Indian authorities have since arrested seven people and suspended three police officials in connection with the attack. The arrest of Das, the Hindu leader, seems to be the latest trigger, but tensions have simmered since Hasina was granted asylum by India. Bangladeshi opposition and activists hold a grudge against India for its support of Hasina’s 15-year rule, marked by a crackdown on dissent and human rights abuse. Anti-India sentiments have increased since August as Hasina has used her base in India to criticise the interim administration headed by Muhammad Yunus, a highly respected economist and Nobel laureate. On Wednesday, Hasina accused Yunus of being involved in “genocide”, adding fuel to the diplomatic fire. “Today, I am being accused of genocide. In reality, Yunus has been involved in genocide in a meticulously designed manner,” she said in her first public address since August. Bangladesh’s demand for the extradition of the removed prime minister seems to be the biggest diplomatic irritant between the two countries. “We will seek the return of the fallen autocrat Sheikh Hasina from India,” Yunus said last month. New Delhi’s vocal stand on minority rights has further irked Dhaka. Yunus has said Bangladesh does not discriminate between citizens based on their faith. According to local media reports, security around Hindu temples and neighbourhoods has been increased. Minorities, particularly Hindus, who form 10 percent of the country’s 170-million population, have borne the brunt of attacks since Hasina’s removal, as they were associated with her Awami League party. Hindus and other minorities now feel vulnerable as right-wing forces are on the rise. In recent days, India has expressed concern at “the surge of extremist rhetoric, increasing incidents of violence and provocation” against minorities. “Our position on the matter is very clear – the interim government must live up to its responsibility of protecting all minorities,” Ministry of External Affairs spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said on Friday, referring to the case against Das. But Dhaka has instead accused New Delhi of exaggerating the attacks. Speaking to Indian channel India Today, Shafiqul Alam, press secretary of the Yunus government, said Hindus were more protected now than they were during Hasina’s government. Mubashar Hasan, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Oslo in Norway, said the attack on Dhaka’s mission in India will “obviously heighten tensions” between the two countries. “It has now completely disrupted the stable relationship that both countries enjoyed under the previous government and there will be lack of trust between the two neighbours. Whether this tension could also impact trade relations, we will need to wait and see,” he told Al Jazeera. India and Bangladesh became close allies under Hasina, leading to a boost in business and security ties. India-Bangladesh bilateral trade was $14bn in 2023-24. New Delhi’s envoy to Dhaka, Pranay Verma, met acting Foreign Secretary Riaz Hamidullah on Tuesday and said the relationship between the two countries could not be based on one agenda. India “is interested in working with the Government of Bangladesh to fulfil our shared aspirations for peace, security and development”, Verma was quoted as saying by The Hindu newspaper. Anil Trigunayat, a former Indian diplomat who has also served in Bangladesh, regretted the attack on Dhaka’s mission. “Relations [between Indian and Bangladesh] will improve in time when mob mentality subsides,” he told Al Jazeera. Trigunayat added that India will continue with its Neighbourhood First Policy – New Delhi’s approach towards its South Asian neighbours. “India also needs to have a better communication strategy and public diplomacy. A possible visit by Indian foreign secretary will seek to address some of the bilateral issues,” he added. Yes, if you believe the interim leader Yunus. “Relations between the two countries must be very close,” the interim leader was quoted as saying by the Bangladeshi daily Prothom Alo on Tuesday. “This is essential from any angle, whether it’s about economics, security or water. “Just as we need them in our interest, they need us in their interest. So, we have to forget certain transient matters … The main thing is to maintain good relations. We have to use everything in our power to advance towards that,” he said. Dhaka and New Delhi share close cultural, trade and geographical ties, and mutual cooperation is crucial in managing their 4,000-km (2,485-mile) border. But Ali Riaz, a professor at Illinois State University in the US, says India’s “warm welcome” to Hasina was “unprecedented”. “Since 2009 India has provided unqualified support to Sheikh Hasina regime, which became autocratic by the day, created an unequal relationship in favour of India, remained instrumental in Bangladesh’s domestic politics and became the shield to the autocratic regime against any international criticisms,” he said. However, Indian diplomat Trigunayat says “there has been an erroneous narrative that has been built against India, accusing it of being supportive of Hasina. “India has provided huge non-reciprocal assistance to Bangladesh for the benefit of the common Bangladeshi people … Today it is fashionable to make India a punching bag in which external powers are also adding fuel by the day,” he added without elaborating who the external powers are. Speaking at a conference last month, India’s envoy Verma said relations between the two countries are “multifaceted” amid “sustained and positive momentum” in trade and economic ties and “people-to-people engagements”. According to Riaz, “the ball is in India’s court” to improve relations. “It is imperative that Indian government sends a clear message that it is ready and willing to make a shift in its policy and work with the current government and the people of Bangladesh … Besides, it is important that Indian government ensures that its land is not being used by Hasina or anyone else for creating instability and violence within Bangladesh,” he added. The recent religious tensions have drawn a response from several Western leaders, including in the United Kingdom and United States. On Tuesday, the Press Trust of India reported that US Congressman Brad Sherman asked Yunus’s government to protect Hindu minorities. A similar concern has also been shared by diplomats in the UK and European Union. Shairee Malhotra, deputy director and Europe fellow at the Observer Research Foundation in New Delhi said policymakers in Europe are also concerned about the current instability but that India would prefer the bilateral route to resolving tensions. “Perhaps where the EU can play a role going forward is in strengthening Bangladesh’s democratic governance structures, which would contribute to political stability within Bangladesh, and in turn more stable relations with India,” she told Al Jazeera. Michael Kugelman, South Asia Institute director at The Wilson Centre, a Washington, DC-based think tank, told Al Jazeera that with multiple conflicts and crises raging across the world, and with the US government in transition mode, there’s unlikely to be much third-party involvement. “India and Bangladesh will need to work this out on their own. The good thing is that despite the tensions, the two sides have kept communication channels open and continued to talk. It’s a strained relationship but not a hostile one,” he said.",2024,12
https://www.aljazeera.com/sports/2024/12/4/bangladesh-beat-west-indies-by-101-runs-to-level-test-series,12/4/2024,"Bangladesh have completed an impressive comeback to beat West Indies in the second Test match by 101 runs and record their first win in the Caribbean since 2009. Taijul Islam snared five wickets for the 15th time in a Test innings to lead Bangladesh’s series-levelling win on the fourth evening of the final Test of the series at Sabina Park on Tuesday.     After Jaker Ali’s Test-best innings of 91 lifted the tourists to 268 all out in their second innings and left the home team with a victory target of 287, left-arm spinner Islam broke the back of the Caribbean side’s effort with 5-50 as they were dismissed for 185 in the day’s final session. Fast bowler Nahid Rana, whose maiden five-wicket haul in the first innings pulled Bangladesh back into contention, had the satisfaction of administering the final rites when he yorked the last man, Shamar Joseph, for his only wicket of the innings. “It’s a great feeling to win a Test match abroad which we don’t often do and all the boys really put in a tremendous effort,” said player-of-the-match Islam. Seamers Taskin Ahmed and Hasan Mahmud took two wickets each, with Taskin emerging as the leading wicket-taker in the brief series with 11 victims to his name. Kavem Hodge top-scored for the West Indies with 55, while captain Kraigg Brathwaite played with unusual adventure at the top of the order contributing 43 off 63 deliveries. But they lost wickets at regular intervals and eventually succumbed in just 50 overs as Bangladesh swiftly avenged the 201-run mauling they endured in the first Test in Antigua a week earlier. “We wanted to be positive and I thought we started well, but obviously we couldn’t carry it through to the end of the day,” said a rueful Brathwaite. This was Bangladesh’s first Test victory in the West Indies since their 2-0 sweep over a depleted Caribbean side in 2009. Earlier Ali’s belligerent innings, which occupied 106 deliveries and was embellished by eight fours and five sixes, tilted the balance heavily in favour of Bangladesh as the highest successful run-chase in a Test at Sabina Park was the 212 achieved by the West Indies over Sri Lanka in 2003. Such was the extent of the 26-year-old right-hander’s dominance of the morning that he contributed 62 of the 75 runs added by the tourists after resuming at the overnight position of 193-5. Alzarri Joseph and Kemar Roach took three wickets each for the West Indies, Joseph ending Ali’s quest for a maiden Test hundred when he was last out, caught at deep midwicket a half-hour before lunch.

https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/11/27/icc-prosecutor-seeks-arrest-warrant-for-myanmar-military-regime-chief,11/27/2024,"The prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC) has requested an international arrest warrant for the military ruler of Myanmar for the persecution of Rohingya. The office of prosecutor Karim Khan said on Wednesday that Min Aung Hlaing, chief of the military government that took control of the country in a coup in 2021, is responsible for crimes against humanity regarding the treatment of the Rohingya minority.     The prosecutor’s office has been investigating alleged crimes committed during 2016-17 violence in the country’s state of Rakhine for the past five years, it said. At that time, the Myanmar military unleashed a brutal crackdown on Rohingya civilians, sending at least 700,000 fleeing into neighbouring Bangladesh amid reports of killings, torture, rape and arson. Military chief Min Aung Hlaing “bears criminal responsibility for the crimes against humanity of deportation and persecution of the Rohingya, committed in Myanmar, and in part in Bangladesh”, the prosecutor’s office said. “My Office alleges that these crimes were committed between 25 August 2017 and 31 December 2017 by the armed forces of Myanmar, the Tatmadaw, supported by the national police, the border guard police, as well as non-Rohingya civilians,” Khan’s statement said. #ICC Prosecutor @KarimKhanQC addresses the Rohingya community on the application for a warrant of arrest in the situation in #Bangladesh/#Myanmar ⤵️https://t.co/OyQHr9q29r pic.twitter.com/vYSJdSNQKe — Int'l Criminal Court (@IntlCrimCourt) November 27, 2024  The work of the ICC seeks to vindicate the resilience of the mainly Muslim minority community of Rohingya – more than a million of whom were forcibly displaced by military action – and “their hope in the power of the law”, the prosecutor added. Zin Mar Aung, foreign minister for Myanmar’s opposition National Unity Government, established by elected lawmakers barred from taking their seats in 2021, said on X that ICC judges should “swiftly issue the warrant” and that governments should “act and enforce this warrant to uphold justice and international law.” Myanmar’s military government in a statement rejected the proceedings, noting it was not party to the ICC and insisting the country’s leadership practiced a policy of “peaceful coexistence.” The judges at the ICC will now determine whether the application can warrant an arrest order. The process could take several months. Turmoil has been building in Myanmar ever since the coup. Armed factions have fought the military government and have gradually scored victories, especially in areas near the border with China. That has stirred tension with Beijing, a major arms supplier to the military government and Myanmar’s biggest trade partner. Analysts note that China also maintains ties with the ethnic armed groups which hold territory along the border. Earlier this month, Min Aung Hlaing embarked on his first visit to China since seizing power, with Beijing reportedly unhappy with his failure to ensure stability and halt criminality.    United Nations investigators said the military campaign against the Rohingya, which involved mass killings, rapes and destruction, was carried out with “genocidal intent”. Myanmar rejects the charges. This was the first application for an arrest warrant against a high-level Myanmar official issued by the ICC. The prosecutor, who was speaking from a refugee camp in Bangladesh, promised “more will follow”. “In doing so, we will be demonstrating, together with all of our partners, that the Rohingya have not been forgotten. That they, like all people around the world, are entitled to the protection of the law,” the British-born barrister said. In 2022, the International Court of Justice (ICJ), the highest court of the UN, advanced a separate case against Myanmar, brought by The Gambia, that investigates responsibility for genocide against the Rohingya. Five European powers and Canada last year joined the ICJ case against Myanmar, arguing they seek to “make a contribution to clarifying and combating genocide”. The request for an arrest warrant on Wednesday comes shortly after the ICC issued international arrest warrants for Israeli and Hamas leaders, six months after the prosecutor sought them.   ",2024,11
https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/11/26/bangladesh-police-clash-with-protesters-as-hindu-leader-detained,11/26/2024,"Police in Bangladesh have used tear gas against Hindus protesting against the arrest of a religious leader as neighbouring India called for ensuring the safety of Hindus and minorities in the Muslim-majority nation. Chinmoy Krishna Das, also known as Krishna Das Prabhu, was arrested at Dhaka airport on Monday on charges including sedition.     A court in the port city of Chittagong on Tuesday denied bail to the priest associated with the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON), widely known as the Hare Krishna movement. According to the city’s police, more than 2,000 supporters surrounded the van and blocked its path for some time when Das was being escorted back to prison from court. The demonstrators threw bricks at the police and officers fired tear gas to disperse the crowds, said Chittagong Metropolitan Police Commissioner Hasib Aziz, who added no one was seriously hurt. Das’s arrest set off protests by his supporters in both Chittagong, the country’s second-largest city, and the capital, Dhaka. India noted the arrest and denial of bail with “deep concern”. The neighbouring Hindu-majority country’s Ministry of External Affairs said in a statement that the incident follows attacks on Hindus and other minorities, along with places of worship, by “extremist elements in Bangladesh”. It said the perpetrators of those incidents remain at large while Bangladeshi authorities pressed charges against “a religious leader presenting legitimate demands through peaceful gatherings”. Sedition charges were filed against Das in October after he led a large rally in Chittagong, during which it is accused he disrespected Bangladesh’s national flag. The rally was aimed at demanding justice for Hindus facing targeted attacks in Bangladesh and seeking better protections for minorities. The interim government, which took over in the aftermath of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina’s flight from the country on August 5 amid a mass uprising against her rule earlier this year, has said the threat to Hindus is being exaggerated and they are working on the issue. While there was large-scale looting and the ransacking of national monuments and government buildings in the wake of Hasina’s overthrow, student leaders who spearheaded the protests had also asked supporters to guard Hindu temples and churches. More than 90 percent of the population in Bangladesh is Muslim, with Hindus – many of who support Hasina’s Awami League party – making up almost all of the rest. “We urge Bangladesh authorities to ensure the safety and security of Hindus and all minorities, including their right of freedom of peaceful assembly and expression,” the Indian ministry said.

https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/11/18/bangladesh-ex-ministers-face-massacre-charges-hasina-probe-deadline-set,11/18/2024,"More than a dozen Bangladeshi former top government officials arrested after a mass uprising in August have been charged with “enabling massacres” before a special tribunal which also told investigators they have one month to complete their work on former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. Dozens of Hasina’s allies were taken into custody since her regime collapsed, accused of involvement in a police crackdown that killed more than 1,000 people during the unrest that led to her removal and exile to India.     Prosecutor Mohammad Tajul Islam on Monday said the 13 defendants, who included 11 former ministers, a judge and an ex-government secretary, were accused of command responsibility for the deadly crackdown on the student-led protest that toppled the regime. “We have produced 13 defendants today, including 11 former ministers, a bureaucrat, and a judge,” Islam, the chief prosecutor of Bangladesh’s International Crimes Tribunal, told reporters. “They are complicit in enabling massacres by participating in planning, inciting violence, ordering law enforcement officers to shoot on sight, and obstructing efforts to prevent a genocide.”    Hasina, who fled to New Delhi by helicopter on August 5, was also due in court in Dhaka on Monday to face charges of “massacres, killings, and crimes against humanity”, but she remained a fugitive in exile, with prosecutors repeating extradition demands for her. Golam Mortuza Majumdar, the head judge of the three-member International Crimes Tribunal, set December 17 for investigators to finish their work. The deadline came after prosecutors sought more time for the investigation. Hasina’s nearly 16-year tenure saw widespread human rights abuses, including the mass detention and extrajudicial killings of her political opponents. “The crimes that led to mass murders and genocide have occurred over the past 16 years across the country,” said Islam.    The tribunal’s chief prosecutor has already sought help from Interpol through the country’s police chief to arrest Hasina. India is a member of Interpol, but this does not mean New Delhi must hand Hasina over as each country applies their own laws on whether an arrest should be made. On Sunday, interim leader and Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus said his administration will seek her extradition from India – a request that could strain relations with a key regional ally, which maintained close ties with the removed leader throughout her time in power. Yunus said as many as 3,500 people may have been abducted during Hasina’s “autocratic” rule. Protests broke out across Bangladesh this summer after college students demanded the abolition of a controversial quota system in government jobs that they said favoured supporters of the governing party. Though Bangladesh’s top court scrapped the quota, the protests soon morphed into a wider call for Hasina’s removal from power. The government’s response was one of the bloodiest chapters in Bangladesh’s history as security forces beat and fired tear gas and live ammunition on peaceful demonstrators, killing more than 1,000 people in three weeks and arresting thousands.

https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/11/17/bangladeshs-yunus-seeks-time-says-election-roadmap-after-reforms,11/17/2024,"Bangladesh‘s interim leader Muhammad Yunus has appealed for the nation’s “patience”, pledging that general elections would be held after electoral and institutional reforms were completed in a televised address marking 100 days in office. “I promise that we will hold the much-anticipated election once the necessary and essential reforms are complete,” said Yunus, who was tasked with leading the transitional government following the ouster of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina in August.     The 84-year-old leader promised that an election commission would be formed “within a few days”, but did not provide a timeline for elections, citing the need for significant electoral and constitutional reforms. “I request your patience until then. We aim to build an electoral system that will endure for decades. For this, we need some time.” The country’s only Nobel laureate, who is renowned for his pioneering work in microfinance, Yunus has been tasked with rebuilding democratic institutions after Hasina’s 15-year rule. Yunus was appointed “chief adviser” on August 9, following student-led protests that ended Hasina’s authoritarian rule. The deadly protests began in July after college students demanded the abolition of a controversial quota system in government jobs that they said favoured supporters of the governing party. Though Bangladesh’s top court scrapped the quota, the protests soon morphed into a wider call for the removal of Hasina’s “autocratic” regime, marked by allegations of widespread rights violations. The government’s response was one of the bloodiest chapters in Bangladesh’s history as security forces beat the protesters, and fired tear gas and live ammunition on peaceful demonstrators, killing more than 1,000 people in three weeks and arresting thousands of others. Yunus on Sunday said about 1,500 people were killed in the weeks of protests that brought down the Hasina government, adding that as many as 3,500 may have been forcibly abducted during her 15-year rule. He promised an investigation into all human rights violations, including alleged enforced disappearances while Hasina was in power. The interim leader said his administration will seek the extradition of the ousted prime minister from India, where she has been in exile since fleeing the student-led mass uprising in August. “We will seek the return of the fallen autocrat Sheikh Hasina from India,” Yunus said. “I have already discussed the issue with Chief Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court Karim Khan.” An arrest warrant has been issued for Hasina, 77, who fled to India via helicopter as demonstrators stormed her residence. She faces charges of “massacres, killings, and crimes against humanity” and has been summoned to appear in a court in Dhaka. The extradition request could strain relations with India, a key regional ally that maintained close ties with Hasina throughout her tenure. “We should be able to resolve it amicably between India and Bangladesh,” Yunus told Al Jazeera in an interview on the sidelines of the COP29 United Nations Climate Change Conference. “We draw attention to the Indian authorities that you are hosting her, that’s fine, but please make sure she doesn’t create problems for us.” Yunus has been talking to political parties, including the Bangladesh Nationalist Party headed by former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia, Hasina’s main rival, which has sought an election in two to three months. The party believes it will form the next government as Hasina’s Awami League party and its allies face a political debacle following her ouster. “As we move forward, we need to complete a lot of work,” Yunus said in his speech. “The train will reach its final station depending on how quickly we can lay down the railway tracks, and this will happen through consensus among the political parties.” In his interview with Al Jazeera, Yunus acknowledged the challenges ahead. “Bangladesh is deep in corruption because of the system that we had for the past 15 years – mismanagement, misgovernance, the destruction of our institutions,” he said, adding that rebuilding the system “point by point, sector by sector” will be a “big task”. International Crisis Group analyst Thomas Kean has called the challenge facing Yunus “monumental”, warning that “cracks are emerging in the fragile alliance” that pushed him into power. “For now, Yunus and his colleagues have widespread support, but popular expectations are double-edged,” the think tank said in a report on Thursday. “If the interim administration falters in making reforms, the outcome is likely to be an early election with little progress; in the worst-case scenario, the military could assume power.”   ",2024,11
https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/11/12/refugees-on-front-lines-of-global-climate-crisis-warns-un,11/12/2024,"Climate change is helping to drive a rising refugee crisis, adding to the huge numbers already displaced by conflict, according to a United Nations report. Three-quarters of the world’s forcibly displaced people live in countries heavily affected by climate hazards, the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) said in the document released on Tuesday.     The number of people fleeing conflict doubled to more than 120 million over the past decade, 90 million of them in countries with high-to-extreme exposure to climate-related hazards, it reported. Half of displaced people are in locations affected by both conflict and serious climate hazards, such as Myanmar, Somalia, Sudan and Syria. “For the world’s most vulnerable people, climate change is a harsh reality that profoundly affects their lives,” said UN High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi. “The climate crisis is driving displacement in regions already hosting large numbers of people uprooted by conflict and insecurity, compounding their plight and leaving them with nowhere safe to go.” About 700,000 people were forced to flee war in Sudan crossing into neighbouring Chad. The country has hosted refugees for years, but is highly exposed to climate change. Those who remain in Sudan are at risk of further displacement due to severe flooding, the report says. More than 70 percent of refugees from Myanmar have sought safety in Bangladesh, where cyclones and flooding are classified as extreme. “In our region, where so many people have been displaced for so many years, we see the effects of climate change before our very eyes,” said Grace Dorong, a climate activist and former refugee living in South Sudan. “I hope the voices of the people in this report help decision-makers to understand that if not addressed, forced displacement – and the multiplying effect of climate change – will get worse. But if they listen to us, we can be part of the solution, too.”    The UN report was released at the COP29 climate meeting in Azerbaijan. Delegates from nearly 200 countries are gathering this week to discuss climate change-related challenges, although larger ones, such as the United States and China, have not sent top-level delegations. The climate summit opened on Monday amid new warnings that 2024 is on track to break temperature records, adding urgency to a fractious debate over climate funding as poorer countries seek an increase in the $100bn-a-year target at the forum. In an interview with Al Jazeera, Damilola Ogunbiyi, UN special representative on sustainable energy, said one of her “key expectations is on the role of climate finance”. “We have a record-breaking year of investments in clean renewable energy. However, only 15 percent of that goes to the Global South,” she said. The recent election of Donald Trump as the US president has added a sense of renewed urgency to the event. Trump has repeatedly threatened to pull the US out of the landmark Paris Agreement to limit global warming.   ",2024,11

The interim government that was put in place to deal with the legacy of Hasina’s 15-year authoritarian rule is led by Nobel laureate Professor Muhammad Yunus and includes civil society leaders.     Yunus, a celebrated civil society activist, is well-equipped to lay the foundations for a new, truly democratic Bangladesh. He can draw on the experiences of Bangladeshi civil society to enable social cohesion and bring about a much-needed reckoning with the country’s tortured past. There are many ways in which he can protect and expand civic spaces. He can, for example, disband security units responsible for enforced disappearances and torture, reform the much-maligned NGO Affairs Bureau to ensure it supports civil society, or amend the Foreign Donations Law which creates a bureaucratic maze for civil society to receive international funding. He should, however, act fast, as history tells us moments of opportunity and optimism like this can be fleeting. After a dictatorial regime is removed through revolution, democratic structures can fall prey to a rotation of elites. In the absence of a plan for what’s next, pro-democracy elements can be overwhelmed and derailed by fast-moving events. In such scenarios, nationalist and authoritarian forces, who continue to hold power due to their alliances with the clergy and military, often fill the emerging power vacuum. At times, the military itself takes over. In other instances, leaders brought in as representatives of democratic forces turn to repression themselves to try and hold everything together. In Sudan, for example, the 2019 overthrow of strongman President Omar al-Bashir was followed by several failed attempts at a democratic transition and eventually a military coup in 2021. Years later, civic space violations continue unabated and the country is still devastated by conflict. In Pakistan, an initial military coup in 1958 supposedly aimed at creating space for a more stable democracy was followed by several decades of military rule and persistent attacks on civil society. Authorities in the country continue to silence dissent with crackdowns on activists, protesters, and journalists. In Ethiopia, when Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed received the Nobel Peace Prize in 2019 for finally securing a peace deal with Eritrea, hopes were high for regional peace and stability. Since then, however, he has presided over a bloody civil war in which mass atrocities were committed. The country is in turmoil, with human rights groups urging authorities to stop their crackdown on civic space and respect the rights of political opponents, journalists, and activists. If Professor Yunus’s government fails to include civil society in decision making and shore up democratic institutions, post-Hasina Bangladesh can also fall into these pitfalls. But these are, of course, not the only possible scenarios. After a revolution, pro-democracy forces can also stay firm and enable the emergence of more complex, but also infinitely more positive, realities. Sri Lanka, where widespread protests forced President Gotabaya Rajapaksa to resign and flee the country two years ago, is one example. Although things were far from perfect, a transition of power occurred through established systems of democracy in the country. Last month, Anura Kumara Dissanayake, who ran on a promise of better governance and stability, won Sri Lanka’s presidential election. Chile is another example of how democratic forces can persevere in the face of elite clawback. Despite significant resistance from establishment forces, Chile’s popular protests in 2019-2022 against economic inequality led to a series of reforms in education, healthcare and pensions. Guatemala, where in January the elected president was inaugurated despite repeated attempts by the old regime to scuttle a peaceful transfer of power, can also offer useful lessons for Bangladesh’s nascent government. In both these instances civil society groups played a key role. While revolutions and popular uprisings did not produce civic utopias and perfect democracies in any of these countries, they also did not result in a return to square one. Bangladesh’s interim government should pay attention to these examples where civic society secured important victories in difficult and complex circumstances. It should, however, also learn from cases where democratic forces failed to prevent the strongmen they helped topple from eventually being replaced by equally corrupt, anti-democratic leaders. It is unrealistic to expect any new government to produce satisfactory reforms in all areas and a perfect democracy overnight, especially after decades of authoritarian rule. But countless examples around the world show that building a better future on the ruins left by long-term authoritarian leaders is possible – as long as the new leadership acts with determination, continues the dialogue with civil society, and remains on a democratic course. If the interim government of Yunus gets it wrong, and the new leadership begins to try and stifle democratic dissent by suppressing civil society and clamping down on protests – whether these protests are by those who support the previous regime or others who are impatient for change – mistakes made during past transitions elsewhere might end up being repeated in Bangladesh. In such a scenario, the sustained protests that removed Hasina, and Yunus’s tenure as leader, would be reduced to footnotes in a long history of authoritarian rule. But if Professor Yunus gets it right, draws from the successful experience of other countries, and lays the foundations for a robust democracy in Bangladesh, he could become a Mandela-like inspirational figure, and provide other countries in South Asia, where civic freedoms are widely repressed, with a regional example of a successful post-revolutionary transition. Many in the international community stand ready to support him. Bangladesh is at a crossroads, and how Yunus and his advisors are able to navigate current political dynamics while respecting human rights and civic freedoms will determine the future of its democracy.

Seamer Kagiso Rabada decimated Bangladesh with five wickets as the Proteas skittled the hosts for 159 in their first innings to take a huge 416-run lead and they turned up the heat further after asking them to bat again on Thursday.     Bangladesh, who lost the opening game by seven wickets in Dhaka, suffered a familiar collapse and were bowled out in the evening session as Keshav Maharaj bagged 5-59 and fellow spinner Senuran Muthusamy took 4-45. Sixteen Bangladesh wickets fell on the day at the Zahur Ahmed Chowdhury Stadium. Rabada dismissed Najmul Hossain Shanto for nine, Mehidy Hasan Miraz for one and Mahidul Islam Ankon for a duck to finish with 5-37 while Dane Paterson got rid of Mushfiqur Rahim for nought as Bangladesh continued to wobble in the first innings. The hosts, who resumed the day on 38-4, staged a fightback from 48-8 with Mominul Haque making 82 but his dismissal shortly after lunch by Muthusamy ended his 103-run ninth-wicket stand with Taijul Islam. Taijul was unable to frustrate the tourists further, as he became Maharaj’s second victim after a defiant 30.

https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/10/27/once-powerful-student-members-of-hasinas-party-bangladeshs-new-outcastes,10/27/2024,"Dhaka, Bangladesh – Since early August, Fahmi*, 24, who used to be a dominant figure on the sprawling campus of Dhaka University in Bangladesh’s capital, has been in hiding. Fahmi was a member of the Bangladesh Chhatra League (BCL), the student wing of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina’s Awami League (AL) party that ruled over the South Asian nation with an iron fist for more than 15 years before she was ousted and forced to flee to neighbouring India following a student-led movement in August.     On Wednesday, Bangladesh’s interim government, led by its only Nobel laureate, Muhammad Yunus, declared the BCL a “terrorist organisation” and banned it. The Ministry of Home Affairs said the BCL had a history of serious misconduct over the past 15 years, including violence, harassment and exploitation of public resources. “Not long ago, I was a voice of authority here,” Fahmi, an undergraduate student of applied chemistry, told Al Jazeera. “Now, I am running around like a fugitive with no probable future.” Fahmi’s story mirrors that of thousands of students formerly affiliated with the AL, whose once-powerful hold over Bangladesh’s campuses collapsed overnight. The former powerbrokers on campuses and the AL’s muscle on the streets now face eviction, retribution and even imprisonment for their role in trying to suppress the popular revolt against Hasina and for the rights violations they allegedly committed while she was in power. Fahmi maintains he did not directly participate in the government’s deadly crackdown against people during the anti-Hasina demonstrations. “My sisters were part of the protests,” he said. “I also believed in the cause but was trapped by party obligations.” The deadly protests began in July after college students demanded the abolition of a controversial reservation system in government jobs that they said favoured supporters of the governing party. Though Bangladesh’s top court scrapped the quota, the protests soon morphed into a wider call for the removal of Hasina’s “autocratic” regime, marked by allegations of widespread rights violations. The government’s response was one of the bloodiest chapters in Bangladesh’s history as security forces beat the protesters, and fired tear gas and live ammunition on peaceful demonstrators, killing more than 1,000 people in three weeks and arresting thousands of others. On August 5, as defiant Bangladeshis stormed prominent government buildings, including Hasina’s residence and the parliament, the 77-year-old prime minister fled the country in a military helicopter and sought refuge in New Delhi.    The violence, however, did not end with Hasina’s fall. The former perpetrators of state atrocities became the new targets as hundreds of AL politicians and members, including students, were attacked or killed. Many went into hiding or were detained while attempting to flee. Fahmi said the anti-Hasina protesters set fire to his family’s home and cold storage business in Noakhali district, 173km (107 miles) from Dhaka. “They threatened to make my younger brother disappear if he didn’t disclose my whereabouts,” he said. So far, they haven’t acted on the threat, said Fahmi, though his younger brother has been bullied at the madrasa [a Muslim educational institution] where he studies. Reflecting on his BCL involvement, Fahmi admitted, “I was a good student who cared little for politics, but at Dhaka University, hall politics was unavoidable. You either joined, or you suffered.” He admitted that being a BCL leader would improve his prospects of landing a government job – an appealing incentive in a shrinking job market – especially since his responsibilities towards his mother, two unmarried sisters, and younger brother grew after his father’s death two years ago. But his loyalty to the Awami League also meant he was not always there for his family when they needed him. On August 15, 2022 – just a day after his father’s passing – he left his grieving family in Noakhali to attend an event in Dhaka marking the anniversary of the death of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, Hasina’s father and the leader of Bangladesh’s movement for independence from Pakistan. “Looking back, I see I prioritised the party’s approval over supporting my family,” Fahmi said with regret. Now, while his erstwhile leader Hasina is safe in India, he faces the constant threat of violence or arrest, a scenario that he says made him feel that he has been abandoned by the party he once represented and the university he is a student of. “The salam [peace] I offered and hours I invested buttering up our leaders and arranging party rallies … now seem meaningless,” he said bitterly. “The party used us as its political pawns but offered no protection when we needed it most. The regime fell suddenly; saving myself from the angry mob was the hardest thing I ever faced that evening. Yet, neither top party leaders nor BCL’s student leaders have checked on me.” With his final year exams under way, he cannot attend classes or complete his degree. “I wanted to join the civil service and serve the nation,” he said. “But stepping on campus could lead to my arrest on dubious charges – or worse, I could be beaten to death.” Fahmi’s situation is far from unique. The Awami League estimates that at least 50,000 of its student affiliates across the nation are now in limbo, struggling to continue their tertiary education. Shahreen Ariana, a BCL leader from Rajshahi University, was arrested on October 18 on “forged charges,” according to her family. She was detained while trying to sit for a term-final exam. Saikat Raihan, another BCL leader at Rajshahi University, was arrested on the same day. The district police, however, claimed that both faced prior cases, but refused to provide documents to back their claim. Meanwhile, the university’s proctor, Mahbubur Rahman, told Al Jazeera, “Other students refused to sit with any BCL leader during the exam.” To prevent any “mob justice,” Ariana and Raihan were handed over to the police. “We had to intervene,” he said. “Otherwise, things could have gotten worse.” On October 25, two more BCL leaders — Abul Hasan Saidi, a finance student and Kazi Shihab Uddin Taimur, an anthropology student — were arrested while appearing for exams at Dhaka University. “There were existing cases against the two students, and they were arrested accordingly,” said university Proctor Saifuddin Ahmed. The wave of violence against Awami League-affiliated students has spread across campuses. On the outskirts of the capital, former Jahangirnagar University BCL activist Shamim Ahmed was beaten to death on September 18, while Masud, another BCL leader, was killed by a mob in Rajshahi on September 7. “These are just the reported cases,” says Redwanul Karim Sagor, who goes by the name Sujon and was a senior BCL leader who is now in hiding. Sujon, nearly six feet tall, was wearing a crumpled black shirt and unpressed pants, his hair untrimmed. During our interview, he repeatedly asked if anyone else knew about the meeting. “There have been more killings, arrests and fabricated cases against us, often in areas we’ve never even visited,” he said.    The interim government that took over after Hasina fled, led by Nobel Laureate Dr Muhammad Yunus, issued a gazette on October 23, officially banning the BCL under the Anti-Terrorism Act 2009 – a law that was brought, ironically, by Hasina’s government soon after it came to power in 2009. This decision came after nationwide protests led by Students Against Discrimination (SAD), the student group that mobilised the students against the Hasina government in July, and other groups demanding BCL’s ban. Abdul Hannan Masud, a founding member of SAD, who earlier demanded this ban, said, “The Chhatra League cannot operate in Bangladesh. All their operatives will be identified nationwide and brought to justice.” Meanwhile, police filed a major case over the July 15 BCL-led attack on protesters, incriminating 391 individuals, including then-Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and several BCL leaders. It also names up to 1,000 unidentified individuals. Since the ban on the student body on October 23, officers in the Dhaka Metropolitan Police (DMP) confirmed to Al Jazeera the arrest of at least 10 BCL leaders from the city. More than 100 student activists were arrested from across the country. “Almost all of these arrests are under cases filed over July protests,” said a senior DMP official, seeking anonymity, “based on no specific charges but under suspicion, and largely because of their affiliation with Chhatra League.” Amid this turbulent environment, Sujon told Al Jazeera he now lives in a secret location. We met on October 21 in a small, rundown cafe made of wood and bamboo over a canal along a desolate road, far from any neighbourhood, where passing cars would occasionally stop. We sat at a corner bench under dim lighting as Sujon constantly shifted his gaze towards the window, his eyes betraying his anxiety, as he kept downing glasses of water. At one point, two cars pulled up outside, their occupants stopping briefly for water. As a broad-shouldered man stepped out, Sujon’s face tensed up, his voice stopping for a moment before he managed to continue sharing his story. “I grew up in a generation that only saw Awami League in power. Aligning with them was the only option,” he said. Sujon was pursuing a bachelor’s degree in physics at Rajshahi University and was one final-term exam away from graduation before the August upheaval forced him into hiding. Khalid Mahmud Chowdhury, a former minister in Hasina’s cabinet, now in exile in India, criticised the interim government for the insecurity faced by BCL students. “This government claims to be building a discrimination-free Bangladesh,” he told Al Jazeera. “Yet it’s depriving thousands of students of their right to education.” He argued that sidelining the BCL, the country’s largest student organisation with an estimated 100,000 members, could have consequences for all of Bangladesh. “How can Dr Yunus hope to build a better future for Bangladesh while excluding such a significant segment of its youth?” Chowdhury emphasised that his party remains loyal to its members. “When the time is right, we will fight for their rights,” he asserted, “and ensure they can complete their education without fear.” Azad Majumder, Muhammad Yunus’s deputy press secretary, told Al Jazeera that “everybody is free to join regular academic activities unless there are any criminal charges against him or her”. However, when asked about the government’s measures to protect students from mob violence or arbitrary arrests, he said, “I have nothing to add.” Rahman, the university proctor, stressed that the campus violence that was common when the BCL dominated should not be repeated in “new” Bangladesh. “Authorities aim to ensure all students graduate without facing violence,” he stated, noting that investigations are under way to identify the perpetrators of violence on the university’s campus from July 15 to August 5. “Any students found guilty will face disciplinary actions according to the university’s code of conduct,” he added. For more than a decade, the BCL ruled campuses with an iron grip. The Chhatra Dal, the student wing of the biggest opposition party, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party, managed to maintain a presence but was often on the defensive. Meanwhile, the Islami Chhatra Shibir, the students’ body of the Jamaat-e-Islami, Bangladesh’s largest Muslim party, was forced underground. Numerous media reports over 16 years show students being forced out of campuses – tortured, or even gruesomely murdered – by BCL members on suspicion of ties to the Shibir, which in August this year was banned by the Hasina government under the same anti-terror law now used against the BCL. The ban on the Shibir was lifted by the Yunus government. And now, the tables have turned on the BCL more broadly, with opposition student wings reclaiming control across campuses. “BCL created a system of modern slavery,” said Abu Shadik, president of the Chhatra Shibir’s Dhaka University unit — the first publicly declared Shibir committee in decades. “Students had to align with BCL to secure dorms; dissenters faced a living inferno. Some joined for survival, others for personal gain.” “All BCL operatives who repressed students or joined the July violence must face justice. The common students have rejected them from society,” he told Al Jazeera. “Even those who didn’t attack but remained silent are culpable. To reconcile, they must admit to BCL’s 16 years of brutality, the July ‘genocide,’ and seek forgiveness. Only then can reintegration be considered.”    In a separate conversation, Nahiduzzaman Shipon, general secretary of the BNP’s Dhaka University unit, recalled the reign of violence on campus when the BCL dominated. “Awami League turned BCL into a force to rig votes, suppress dissent, and bypass the law,” he stated. Shipon added that the BCL used sickles, machetes and firearms against their peers. “After 2009, many Chhatra Dal [BNP] members were tortured and forced off campuses, their education cut short.” While exact figures on BCL-linked killings are unavailable, the opposition estimates suggest that the toll runs into the hundreds. Still, Shipon insists, his party, the BNP, is not advocating for vigilante justice against BCL members. “Any student without criminal charges is welcome back to campus, regardless of their political affiliations,” he said. “But those who used brutality as political enforcers must be held accountable under Bangladeshi law.” A law that the party of students like Fahmi once controlled has now turned against them.",2024,10
https://www.aljazeera.com/sports/2024/10/21/bangladeshi-cricketer-shakib-al-hasans-fans-attacked-by-rivals-in-dhaka,10/21/2024,"A group of fans calling for Bangladesh cricket icon Shakib Al Hasan to play in a farewell Test match were attacked by rival protesters wielding sticks and bamboo before the first Test against South Africa in Dhaka, police say. The star all-rounder’s fans, self-proclaimed “Shakibians”, had gathered outside the Sher-e-Bangla Stadium in the capital on Sunday, asking for Shakib’s inclusion in the Bangladesh squad.     Police said trouble began when protesters opposed to Shakib’s return for the match attacked his supporters, while the touring South African team trained at the venue. “Army personnel quickly came and brought the situation under control,” a police official was quoted as saying by the Reuters news agency on Monday. Reports in Bangladeshi media said the protesters demanded “justice” for the cricketer. The fans, some wearing the Bangladesh cricket team’s shirts, dispersed after being charged by rival protesters. Shakib was a member of the Bangladeshi parliament for the Awami League, led by Sheikh Hasina, whose 15-year rule as prime minister ended in August with her fleeing to India following deadly protests that began in July. The former Bangladesh captain has not been in the country since the protests began in July but the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) had assured him he would not be harassed on his return and he was due to play his final Test match in the series that began on Monday. However, the 37-year-old pulled out of the series after fans opposing his return launched protests in advance of the series. “I was to return home … but now I don’t think I can,” Shakib told broadcaster bdnews24.com on Thursday. “It is over a security issue, a matter of my own security.” Shakib announced his intention to retire from Tests and T20 internationals in September and confirmed that the ICC Champions Trophy 2025, to be held in Pakistan, will be his last tournament in the 50-over format. The star player expressed his regret for not addressing the protests earlier but urged his supporters to attend the Test series. In a long note posted on his official Facebook page earlier this month, Shakib said he was “sincerely apologetic” for not speaking up during the protests. “I pay my respects to all the students who sacrificed their lives,” the note said. “While nothing can fill the void of losing a child or a brother, I sincerely apologise to everyone who was hurt by my silence. I too would have been upset if I were in your place.” Regarded as arguably the greatest cricketer in Bangladesh’s history, Shakib’s political background has made his return to the country unlikely, especially with an interim government managing the transition of power. He was playing in a domestic Twenty20 cricket competition in Canada when the government collapsed in July, and has not returned to Bangladesh since. He, however, toured Pakistan and India with the Bangladeshi team with the approval of the interim government established to govern the country after Hasina’s departure. In a remarkable career that includes 71 Tests, 247 One-Day Internationals (ODI), and 129 T20Is, the middle-order batter and left-arm spin bowler has amassed 14,730 runs and taken 712 wickets. Shakib last played an international cricket match in Bangladesh in May, in the T20 series against Zimbabwe.",2024,10

What: Final, ICC Women’s T20 World Cup 2024
When: Sunday, October 20, 6pm (14:00 GMT)
Where: Dubai International Stadium, Dubai, United Arab Emirates
Follow Al Jazeera’s live text and photo coverage Whatever the result in Dubai on Sunday, there will be a new name on the trophy when New Zealand line up against South Africa in the final of the Women’s T20 World Cup.     Australia’s dominance over the years, winning six of the eight previous tournaments, has restricted the opportunities for anyone else. Only England, in the inaugural tournament of 2009, and West Indies in 2016 have seen them off. The Australians have also appeared in seven of the eight finals – not to be this time after South Africa’s dominant semifinal victory on Thursday. It promises to be a fitting finale to a competition that has produced some excellent – and some middling – cricket after it was switched at short notice to the United Arab Emirates following political unrest in Bangladesh where it was due to take place. Apart from bringing new interest to the women’s game, Sunday’s final will also pit the two sides that have played the canniest and most courageous cricket during the competition. Unlike others, they have also largely held their catches, although the White Ferns did make life more awkward for themselves in their semifinal win against the West Indies by dropping Deandra Dottin twice. Not many teams get away with that. After making just 128-9, which even on a slow Sharjah pitch felt 10 to 15 runs short, the Kiwis defended that total superbly against a batting lineup which, as England found to their discomfort in their winner-takes-all group match, takes no prisoners. Amelia Kerr, the leading wicket-taker for the tournament with 12, and Eden Carson bowled superbly, leading skipper Sophie Devine to look optimistically towards the final. “We are really excited about the final. We have nothing to lose and that is a great space to be,” said Devine who was in the team that lost to Australia by three runs in the 2010 final, the latter of New Zealand’s two previous finals. “We are going to win this thing now.” She is more than aware, however, of the dangers presented by a South African side that went close last year, losing to Australia by 19 runs in the final in Cape Town. The Proteas also bowled the White Ferns out for 67 in that edition to win by 65 runs in their group-stage encounter. “They are an incredible side,” said Devine, picking out captain Laura Wolvaardt, the evergreen all-rounder Marizanne Kapp and number three batter Anneke Bosch, whose stunning 74 not out led South Africa to their eight-wicket win over the Australians in Thursday’s semifinal. “Laura leads them from the front,” she said. “Kapp is one of the best players in the world (and) Bosch in the game against Australia was superb. But we have to focus on ourselves, and hope the cricketing gods are on our side as well.” The South Africans have also grown in the last 12 months with that trio of players at the forefront of the batting while Nonkululeko Mlaba, equal second-highest wicket-taker with 10, has led the bowling attack with strong backing, especially from Kapp and Ayabonga Khaka. “I’m just incredibly proud of everyone and the team and just the way that we approached this whole World Cup and how we’ve played throughout,” said Bosch after her match-winning knock. “I think we kind of said we haven’t played our best game yet and probably still haven’t. But hopefully we’re leaving it for the finals now.” The teams have faced each other 15 times in T20 matches since 2005. South Africa enjoyed an 8-7 advantage over New Zealand in that time. Runners-up: 2023 Runners-up: 2009, 2010 South Africa storm into the final as the only team to have beaten Australia this year. First, when they bowled out the champions for 149 in a one-day international in February, and then in Thursday’s semifinal. The Proteas have lost one game in the tournament and won an away T20 series against Pakistan. Last five matches: W W W L W The White Ferns opened their World Cup campaign with a win over pre-tournament favourites India, and closed their group phase by knocking them out with a win over Pakistan. Their only loss in the tournament came against the side South Africa defeated in the first semifinal, the defending champions Australia. Last five matches: W W W L W Teams winning the toss have chosen to bat first in five of the nine games played in Dubai during this tournament with the hot weather likely affecting the decision. However, South Africa, having won the toss and fielded, bring the knowledge of Thursday’s win against Australia into the match. India’s 172-3 win against Sri Lanka remains the highest total at the venue although it has also produced a number of low-scoring encounters. Heat will continue to play a role in the final despite the evening start. The temperature will hover at about 35 degrees Celsius (95 degrees Fahrenheit), and the forecast for 50 percent humidity will make the conditions hot and sticky for the players. South Africa are not expected to make any changes to the side that sealed their spot in the final with a victory against Australia. Squad: Laura Wolvaardt (captain, wicketkeeper), Anneke Bosch, Tazmin Brits, Nadine de Klerk, Annerie Dercksen, Mieke de Ridder (wicketkeeper), Ayanda Hlubi, Sinalo Jafta (wicketkeeper), Marizanne Kapp, Ayabonga Khaka, Sune Luus, Nonkululeko Mlaba, Seshnie Naidu, Tumi Sekhukhune, Chloe Tryon New Zealand have been spared from major injuries to their usual-playing XI and are expected to field the same side that beat West Indies in the semifinal.

https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/10/17/bangladesh-court-seeks-arrest-of-ex-pm-hasina-for-crimes-against-humanity,10/17/2024,"A Bangladeshi court has ordered the arrest of self-exiled former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, who fled to India more than two months ago after being toppled in a student-led uprising. Mohammad Tajul Islam, chief prosecutor of Bangladesh’s International Crimes Tribunal (ICT), said on Thursday the court had issued arrest warrants for Hasina and 45 others, ordering that they attend court by November 18, according to The Daily Star local newspaper.     “Sheikh Hasina was at the helm of those who committed massacres, killings and crimes against humanity in July to August,” Islam said, referring to a crackdown on student protests, which killed more than 1,000 people, according to the interim Health Ministry. The student-led movement began with demonstrations demanding the government abolish its practice of reserving a third of civil service jobs for relatives of war veterans, before spiralling into wider protests calling for Hasina’s resignation. Human rights groups accused the prime minister of using excessive force against protesters, a charge she denied. After weeks of nationwide unrest, Hasina resigned and fled to India in early August. She was replaced by Nobel Peace Prize-winning economist Muhammad Yunus, who is currently leading the country’s interim government.    Hasina has not been seen in public since leaving Bangladesh. The 77-year-old’s last official whereabouts is a military airbase near India’s capital, New Delhi. Her presence in India has infuriated Bangladesh, which has revoked Hasina’s diplomatic passport. The two countries have a bilateral extradition treaty which could theoretically compel her to return to face criminal trial. However, a clause in the treaty says extradition might be refused if the offence is of a “political character”. It is not clear whether the former pro-democracy icon, who critics say had become increasingly autocratic during her 15-year reign, will remain in India or head elsewhere. It was Hasina’s government that created the deeply contentious ICT in 2010 to probe atrocities during the 1971 independence war from Pakistan. The United Nations and rights groups have criticised its procedural shortcomings, with the court often seen as a means for Hasina to eliminate political opponents. Several cases accusing Hasina of orchestrating the “mass murder” of protesters are being investigated by the court.",2024,10
https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2024/10/13/choosing-to-be-child-free-in-an-apocalyptic-south-asia,10/13/2024,"Zuha Siddiqui is currently designing her new house in Karachi, creating a blueprint for her future life in Pakistan’s largest metropolis. Her parents will live in the downstairs portion of this house, “because they’re growing old, and they don’t want to climb stairs”, she says.     She will live in a separate portion upstairs, with furniture she likes. Siddiqui feels this is important because she recently celebrated her 30th birthday and wants a place she can finally call her own, she tells Al Jazeera over a phone call. Siddiqui has worked as a journalist reporting on topics including technology, climate change and labour in South Asia for the past five years. She now works remotely, freelancing for local and international publications. Despite all her plans for a family home of her own, Zuha is one of a growing number of young people in South Asia for whom the future does not involve having children. A demographic challenge is looming over South Asia. As is the case in much of the rest of the world, birth rates are on the decline. While a declining birth rate has been mostly associated with the West and Far East Asian countries such as Japan and South Korea, countries in South Asia where birth rates have generally remained high are finally showing signs of following the same path. Generally, to replace and maintain current populations, a birth rate of 2.1 children per woman is required, Ayo Wahlberg, a professor in the anthropology department at the University of Copenhagen, told Al Jazeera. According to a 2024 US Central Intelligence Agency publication comparing fertility rates around the world, in India, the 1950 birth rate of 6.2 has plummeted to just above 2; it is projected to fall to 1.29 by 2050 and just 1.04 by 2100. The fertility rate in Nepal is now just 1.85; in Bangladesh, 2.07. In Pakistan, the birth rate remains above the replacement rate at 3.32 for now but it is clear that young people there are not immune to the pressures of modern life. “My decision to not have children is purely monetary,” says Siddiqui. Siddiqui’s childhood was marked by financial insecurity, she says. “Growing up, my parents didn’t really do any financial planning for their children.” This was the case for several of her friends, women in their 30s who are also deciding not to have children, she adds. While her parents sent their children to good schools, the costs of an undergraduate or graduate education were not accounted for and it is not common for parents in Pakistan to set aside funds for a college education, she says. While Siddiqui is single, she says her decision not to have children would stand even if she was attached. She made her decision soon after she became financially independent in her mid-20s. “I don’t think our generation will be as financially stable as our parents’ generation,” she says. High inflation, rising living costs, trade deficits and debt have destabilised Pakistan’s economy in recent years. On September 25, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) approved a $7bn loan programme for the country. Like many young people in Pakistan, Siddiqui is deeply worried about the future and whether she will be able to afford a decent standard of living. Even though inflation has fallen, living costs continue to rise in the South Asian country, albeit at a slower rate than before. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose by 0.4 percent in August after a 2.1 percent increase in July, local media reported. Pakistan is not alone. Most countries in South Asia are grappling with slow economic growth, rising inflation, job shortages and foreign debt. Meanwhile, as the global cost of living crisis continues, couples find they have to work more hours than before, leaving limited room for a personal life or to dedicate to children. Sociologist Sharmila Rudrappa conducted a study among IT workers in India’s Hyderabad, published in 2022, on “unintended infertility”, which examined how individuals might not experience infertility early in their lives but might make decisions that lead them to infertility later on due to circumstances. Her study participants told her that they “lacked time to exercise; they lacked time to cook for themselves; and mostly, they lacked time for their relationships. Work left them exhausted, with little time for social or sexual intimacy.” Mehreen*, 33, who is from Karachi, identifies strongly with this. She lives with her husband as well as his parents and elderly grandparents. Both she and her husband work full-time and say they are “on the fence” about having children. Emotionally, they say, they do want to have children. Rationally, it’s a different story. “I think work is a big part of our lives,” Mehreen, who works in a corporate job at a multinational company, told Al Jazeera. They are “almost sure” they will not have children, citing the expense of doing so as one of the reasons. “It’s ridiculous how expensive the entire activity has become,” says Mehreen. “I feel like the generation before us saw it [the cost of raising children] as an investment in the kid. I personally don’t look at it that way,” she says, explaining that many from the older generations saw having children as a way of providing themselves with financial security in the future – children would be expected to provide for their parents in old age. That won’t work for her generation, she says – not with the economic decline the country is undergoing. Then there is the gender divide – another major issue where the younger generation differs from their parents. Mehreen says she is keenly aware that there is a societal expectation for her to take the front seat in parenting, rather than her husband, despite the fact that both of them are earning money for the household. “It is a natural understanding that even though he would want to be an equal parent, he’s just not wired in this society to understand as much about parenting. “My husband and I see ourselves as equal partners but do our respective mums see us as equal partners? Maybe not,” she says. Besides money and domestic responsibilities, other factors have influenced Mehreen’s decision as well. “Obviously, I always think that the world is going to end anyway. Why bring a life into this messed-up world?” she says dryly. Like Mehreen, many South Asians are anxious about raising children in a world marred with climate change, in which the future seems uncertain. Mehreen remembers how, as a child, she never thought twice about eating seafood. “Now, you have to think so much, considering microplastics and all of that. If it is this bad now, what will happen 20 years, 30 years from now?” In her essay collection, Apocalypse Babies, Pakistani author and teacher Sarah Elahi chronicles the difficulties of being a parent now when climate anxiety dominates the concerns of children and young people. She writes about how climate change was an issue brushed under the rug throughout her childhood in Pakistan. However, with rising global temperatures, she notices how her own children and students are increasingly living with constant “anthropogenic anxiety”. Elahi’s sentiments ring true for many. From increased flight turbulence to scorching heatwaves and deadlier floods, the debilitating effects of environmental damage threaten to make life more difficult in the coming years, say experts and organisations including Save the Children. Siddiqui says she realised it would not be viable to have children when she was reporting on the environment as a journalist in Pakistan. “Would you really want to bring a child into a world which might be a complete disaster once you die?” she asks. Several writers and researchers, including those affiliated with the United States think tank Atlantic Council and University College London (UCL), agree that South Asia is among the regions of the world bearing the brunt of climate change. The 2023 World Air Quality report published by Swiss climate group IQAir found that cities in South Asian countries including Bangladesh, Pakistan and India have the worst air quality of 134 countries monitored. Poor air quality affects all aspects of human health, according to a review published by the Environmental Research Group at Imperial College London in April 2023. That review found that when pregnant women inhale polluted air, for example, it can hinder the development of the fetus. Additionally, it established links between poor air quality and low birth weight, miscarriages and stillbirths. For young women like Siddiqui and Mehreen, these are all just more reasons not to have children. Siddiqui has built herself a strong support system of friends who share her values; a best friend since the 9th grade, her former college roommate and some people she has become close to in recent years. In an ideal world, she says, she would be living in a commune with her friends. Fears about being lonely in the future sometimes still creep up in Siddiqui’s mind, however. A week before she spoke to Al Jazeera, she was sitting in a cafe with two of her friends – women in their late 30s who, like her, are not interested in having children. They talked about their fears of dying alone. “It’s something that plagues me quite a bit,” Siddiqui told her friends. But, now, she shakes this off, hoping it is an irrational fear. “I don’t want to have kids simply for the sake of having someone to take care of me when I’m 95. I think that’s ridiculous.” Siddiqui says she discussed the cafe conversation with her best friend. “She was like, ‘No, you’re not gonna die alone. I will be there’.” *Name changed for anonymity.

https://www.aljazeera.com/sports/2024/10/1/indias-batting-blitz-yields-stunning-win-over-bangladesh-in-rain-hit-test,10/1/2024,"India won a race against time to pull off a remarkable seven-wicket win over Bangladesh in the rain-hit second Test match. Yashasvi Jaiswal smashed 51 as India, needing 95 for victory, reached 98-3 in just 104 balls in the second session on the final day at Kanpur.     A draw loomed large over the match after two and a half days were lost to bad weather with only 35 overs played in the first three days at the Green Park Stadium. Jaiswal reached his second fifty of the match in 43 balls including eight fours and one six before falling to Taijul Islam, ending a 58-run stand with Virat Kohli. Former captain Kohli hit 29 and was there at the end as Rishabh Pant hit the winning boundary. Bangladesh spinner Mehidy Hasan Miraz had earlier removed Rohit Sharma, for eight, and Shubman Gill, for six. India rode on Jaiswal’s 72-run blitz in the first innings to force a result in a match which saw no play on Saturday and Sunday because of rain and a wet outfield. India’s captain Rohit said his team wanted to force a result despite the loss of time. “We had to think a lot to keep the game moving forward,” Rohit said after the match. Bangladesh resumed their second innings on 26-2 but the batting fell apart during the first session, with opener Shadman Islam top-scoring on 50. The hosts bundled out Bangladesh for 146 before lunch on the final day. Off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin broke through in the third over of the day when he had first-innings centurion Mominul Haque caught at leg slip by KL Rahul for two. Left-arm spinner Ravindra Jadeja, who had taken his 300th Test wicket on Monday, struck in his first over of the day when he bowled Najmul, who had made 19. Shadman reached his fifty off 97 balls but fell almost immediately after to fast bowler Akash Deep. Jadeja also picked up the wicket of veteran all-rounder Shakib Al Hasan, caught and bowled without scoring, in what could be the former captain’s last Test for Bangladesh. “We didn’t bat well,” admitted Bangladesh captain Najmul Hossain Shanto. “If you look at all our batters, they played 30 to 40 balls and then got out. It’s important for one batsman to get big runs.” Even after India bowled out Bangladesh for 233 on day four, few expected a result until India came out to bat for the first time. Opener Rohit himself led from the front, whacking the first two balls he faced for sixes and India went on to eclipse Bangladesh’s total in 28 overs scoring at a rate unprecedented in test cricket. By the end of day four, India declared their innings on 285-9 and even removed both the Bangladesh openers. “When we came on day four, we wanted to get them out as early as possible and see what we can do with the bat,” Rohit told reporters. “It was a risk that we were willing to take … when you are trying to bat like that, it’s very easy to get bundled out for a low score as well. Even if we got all out for 150, we wanted to give ourselves a chance to get a result.” Earlier on Monday, it was breathtaking batting as India reached 50 in three overs, 100 in 10.1 overs, and 200 in 24.2 overs – the fastest ever by a Test team. The series victory extends India’s lead at the top of the World Test Championship rankings ahead of Australia in second.",2024,10
https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/10/1/fishy-diplomacy-what-a-hilsa-ban-reveals-about-india-bangladesh-tensions,10/1/2024,"Hilsa is Bangladesh’s national fish. Locally known as ilish, it is cherished as the queen among fish and forms part of the culinary identity of both Bangladesh and the bordering Indian state of West Bengal. Former Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina used the fish – which is found in the Bay of Bengal and in rivers – as a tool of diplomacy to foster ties with its western neighbour, India.     But Bangladesh’s interim government’s decision to briefly ban exports of the fish to India in September caused a culinary crisis of sorts ahead of the festival of Durga Puja in India. Hilsa fish cooked in mustard sauce is a popular delicacy during the festival. Some experts viewed the move as a diplomatic rebuke for New Delhi’s backing of Hasina, who has taken shelter in India after her removal in late August. Dhaka insisted the ban aimed to reduce the cost of the freshwater fish domestically amid a leaner harvest this year. It, however, reversed its order within two weeks. So what is the fish at the centre of it all, and is it more than just a popular meal? Bangladesh exports 70 percent of the world’s hilsa. But the prized catch is increasingly becoming rare and expensive, owing to overfishing, increased demand and environmental challenges like climate change. Fishermen this year say they are also struggling to catch adequate amounts of hilsa due to rough sea conditions. The exports add to the scarcity, with the fish unaffordable to most Bangladeshis due to its high cost. In 2024, the price of a 1.5kg hilsa fish reached about $15 (1,800 Bangladeshi taka) in local markets, compared with about $10.9 (1,300 taka) last year. At 550,000 to 600,000 tonnes a year, hilsa contributes about 12 percent of Bangladesh’s total fish production, supporting approximately 500,000 fishers directly and two million people in related industries. Some cherished staples of local cuisine include bhapa ilish (steamed hilsa), ilish polao (pilaf rice with hilsa), and shorshe ilish (hilsa in mustard sauce). In September, Dhaka imposed an export ban on hilsa, specifically targeting shipments to India. This came in the run-up to the Durga Puja festival in October when demand typically peaks across the border. Fisheries officials explained that the ban was necessary to prioritise domestic supply and manage the declining hilsa population. “We cannot allow ilish to be exported while our own people cannot buy them. This year, I have instructed the Ministry of Commerce to prevent any ilish exports to India during Durga Puja,” Farida Akhter, adviser to the Bangladesh Ministry of Fisheries and Livestock told the Dhaka Tribune. However, weeks later, the Commerce Ministry reversed the ban and approved a 3,000-tonne shipment to India. “Against the backdrop of appeals by the exporters, approval has been given to export 3,000 tonnes of hilsa fish (to India), fulfilling the specific conditions on the occasion of the upcoming Durga Puja,” read the ministry’s statement. Hilsa prices have shot up sharply in India as Dhaka reduced exports by 1,000 tonnes. But the government has failed to bring down the prices in Bangladesh. “A syndicate of fishermen who smuggled hilsa to India kept the price high,” said Khandakar Tahmid Rejwan, a research data analyst at the Bangladesh Peace Observatory under the Centre for Alternatives. An expert from India said the brief ban marked “a firm departure” from Hasina’s practice of using the fish as a symbol of goodwill and friendship between Dhaka and New Delhi. Hasina first used the fish as a diplomatic tool when she came to power in 1996. She gifted hilsa to then-West Bengal Chief Minister Jyoti Basu ahead of a landmark agreement on sharing water, a major bilateral issue between the neighbours. In 2016, the former Bangladeshi prime minister sent a consignment of hilsa to Mamata Banerjee, who heads the government of West Bengal bordering Bangladesh. A year later, former President Pranab Mukherjee, a prominent Bengali leader of the time, was gifted hilsa as a gesture of friendship. But the interim government is likely to diverge from Hasina’s pro-India foreign policy, according to an expert on India-Bangladesh relations. The move by the interim government “compromises the goodwill” between the two nations, Sohini Bose, associate fellow at the Observer Research Foundation in Kolkata, told Al Jazeera via email. No. Bangladesh imposed a ban on hilsa exports to India in 2012 following disputes over a water-sharing agreement. This was eventually lifted in January 2018 as a goodwill gesture. Additionally, over the years Hasina’s government frequently made exceptions to the ban by “gifting” hundreds of tonnes of the fish ahead of Durga Puja. Bangladesh also periodically imposes local bans on fishing hilsa to protect it during breeding periods. The main ban is enforced for 22 days during October and has been a practice since 2007. This restriction during hilsa’s spawning season gives it time to reproduce undisturbed. The downside is that this poses economic challenges for fishermen, many of whom rely on hilsa for their livelihood.    Hasina has also gifted locally made sarees and mangoes to leaders across the border. In 2021, Hasina reportedly sent 2,600kg of Haribhanga mangoes to Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee. The gesture came as Bangladesh faced a delay in the supply of COVID-19 vaccine doses from India. India backed Hasina until the end of her 15-year rule, which rights group say was marked by human rights abuses, electoral manipulations and a crackdown on opposition parties. New Delhi also observed silence on a government crackdown that killed more than 300 protesters, shortly before she fled Bangladesh. India’s hosting of Hasina has not gone down well with the interim government, which has sought Hasina’s extradition – a demand New Delhi is unlikely to honour. Many in Bangladesh perceive New Delhi’s backing of Hasina as enabling her heavy-handed approach. In her 15-year rule, Hasina fostered close ties with India, particularly through security cooperation agreements, which critics and opposition parties said were biased in favour of New Delhi. Vilification of Bangladeshis by the Hindu nationalist government in India as “infiltrators” and “termites” has also angered Bangladeshis. Last week, Dhaka condemned “a highly deplorable” speech by Indian Home Minister Amit Shah. Addressing a political rally in the eastern state of Jharkhand, Shah said if a BJP government was elected in the state, “We will hang every Bangladeshi infiltrator upside down to give them a lesson”. Dhaka has also complained about the killing of its citizens at the border by India’s Border Security Force. Rights groups have slammed the “unlawful killings and abuse of Bangladeshi people at the border”. Rising Islamophobia and attacks against Muslims under Modi have also instilled anti-India sentiments in Bangladesh. Moreover, the Hasina government’s trade deals with Indian corporations also came under scrutiny, with critics accusing her of signing deals that benefitted Indian companies. The Teesta River dispute also remains a major point of contention between Bangladesh and India, as both countries rely heavily on its water for agriculture. Bangladesh has long sought a fairer allocation of the river’s flow, arguing that the current arrangement – controlled primarily by India – causes water shortages during the dry season. Additionally, the sudden release of water during heavy rainfall has contributed to flash floods in Bangladesh, including in August this year. Officials at Bangladesh’s Flood Forecasting and Warning Centre told Al Jazeera that unlike in the past, India did not issue a warning to its neighbour about the release of water last month. India’s Ministry of External Affairs dismissed the reports, calling them “factually not correct”. India, particularly its West Bengal state, has resisted changes to the existing river-sharing agreement, citing its own agricultural needs. India’s ties to Hasina’s party, the Awami League, go back to when the party was fighting for liberation from Pakistan in the 1970s. New Delhi has cultivated close ties with the secular Awami League and has seen the opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party and Jamaat-e-Islami as soft on Pakistan. Interim leader Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus has called for a reset in relations. Earlier this month, he criticised Hasina for giving directives from her haven in India, adding that her continued interference in Bangladeshi politics could exacerbate tensions. He has also warned India to move away from its narrative that Islamist forces, supported by groups like Jamaat-e-Islami, are overtaking the country. India’s Fish Importers Association earlier this month in a letter urged Dhaka to allow exports of the fish, especially for the festival. Rejwan, the researcher based in Dhaka, says “the resentment that was building in common people is reflecting in a more formal diplomatic channel”, adding that previously the relationship was only warm at the highest level. He says, however, that there is potential for India and Bangladesh’s relationship to be mutually beneficial, but that it must be based on equity and see progress with key issues such as border killings. “If the government fails to address these and maintain a balance with New Delhi, then it will be perceived as similar to Sheikh Hasina’s regime,” he added. Bose from the Observer Research Foundation believes the two countries have the potential to improve relations due to the existing, “natural” interdependence. “With adjacent territories across the world’s fifth-longest boundary, Bangladesh and India have several common resources from trade of daily essentials to familial connections,” Bose said. “This geographic reality is indisputable despite any political transition, which makes it necessary for India and Bangladesh to maintain a functional relationship.”",2024,10
https://www.aljazeera.com/sports/2024/9/29/womens-t20-cricket-world-cup-2024-top-10-players-to-watch,9/29/2024,"Some of cricket’s finest talent will be on display at the ICC Women’s T20 World Cup 2024, which gets under way with a match between Bangladesh and Scotland in Sharjah, the United Arab Emirates, on Thursday. All 10 teams will rely on the experience of their big-name players to lead them all the way to glory in the October 20 final in Dubai.     Al Jazeera picks the 10 players to watch out for at the ninth edition of the tournament. Athapathuthu, with her impressive all-round skills, will be at the forefront of Sri Lanka’s campaign in the tournament. The Sri Lankan captain is ranked fifth in the ICC’s Women’s T20 all-rounder standings and recently led her country to their first-ever Asia Cup title. The 34-year-old bowls accurate off-spin and can be an explosive batter in the shortest format of the game. Athapaththu has made 246 international appearances since her debut – at the age of 19 – in the T20 World Cup in 2006 and boasts a wealth of experience in franchise T20 cricket as well. Sharma will be crucial to India’s chances as her nation’s highest-ranked bowler (2nd) and all-rounder (3rd) in the T20 format. The 27-year-old off-break bowler and left-handed batter has appeared 211 times for her country. The cool-headed Indian star was one of the leading performers at the Women’s Hundred tournament in England, where her monstrous six-off sealed the title for London Spirit. Sana, who made her debut in 2019 at the age of 18, is the rising star of Pakistan cricket and its great hope following its difficult recent run. Although yet to score a fifty for her country, the fast-bowling all-rounder has scored a minimum of 20 runs in her last six international innings. The young captain will look to add more wickets to her 31 in dismissals in T20s if Pakistan are to make a mark on tournament. Mandhana has been a mainstay of India’s batting since making her debut in 2014. The Indian vice-captain is the second highest run-getter in T20 internationals with 56 half-centuries to her name. The 28-year-old from Mumbai led her Bengaluru franchise to their maiden Women’s Premier League title earlier this year and will look to help India do the same in T20 World Cup. Smriti Mandhana claimed her maiden ICC Player of the Month award for a spectacular showing in June 👌 More ➡ https://t.co/jmp8DAqanM pic.twitter.com/LNSE0ylygI — ICC (@ICC) July 9, 2024  Opening batter Mooney currently tops the ICC’s T20 batter rankings and is one of the many big-name players in an experienced Australian squad. The 30-year-old, who made her debut for Queensland aged 16, has registered two centuries and 23 fifties in 95 innings for the reigning champions. Akter is one wicket shy of 100 in T20 internationals with an average of only 16. The left-arm finger spinner has best bowling figures of 5-8 in 87 T20 internationals at only 24 years of age. Akter claimed 2-17 on debut nine years ago as a 15-year-old against Pakistan in Karachi. A leg-spinner of great promise, the 25-year-old has already claimed 54 T20 wickets at an average of 15 in 53 matches for Scotland. Maqsood’s contributions could elevate the Scottish team to the next level, especially given the spinner-friendly conditions in the UAE. The dependable spinner could turn this World Cup into a breakthrough international tournament for herself and her country, who are making their T20 World Cup debut. Wolvaardt will seek to captain her side to the final step having been runners-up at the last edition. The 25-year-old has a wealth of experience having made her debut as a 16-year-old in an ODI against England in 2016. The right-handed opening batter is fifth in the T20 rankings, her country’s highest in any discipline, and has one century and 11 fifties in 66 T20 innings for her country. Ecclestone is the highest-ranked bowler in both the ICC T20 and ODI rankings. The left-arm finger spinner has made 159 appearances in all formats for England at only 25 years of age and has 126 wickets in 85 T20 internationals at an average of only 14. Having made her debut for her country at 17, Ecclestone had claimed the number one ranking in T20s by the age of 20. The West Indies captain currently enjoys the position of the world’s top all-rounder and is third in the batting rankings. Matthews’ reputation long preceded her international debut at the age of only 16, and at 25 she has already amassed 180 appearances for West Indies and has two centuries and 13 fifties in 96 T20 internationals.",2024,9

https://www.aljazeera.com/sports/2024/9/26/bangladeshs-shakib-al-hasan-to-quit-international-cricket-in-march-2025,9/26/2024,"Bangladesh’s former captain Shakib Al Hasan, facing prosecution at home, has announced plans to retire from international cricket in March 2025 after representing his country for 18 years. Shakib is facing murder charges in Bangladesh, along with dozens of other members of ex-premier Sheikh Hasina’s party who are accused of culpability in a deadly police crackdown on protesters in July and August.     He has not returned home since the toppling of Hasina’s government in August but on Thursday he confirmed that he intends to play one last Test series at home. The 37-year-old has expressed his desire to represent Bangladesh during the upcoming Test series against South Africa, but his return to the country remains doubtful amid the current political climate. “I have said this to BCB [Bangladesh Cricket Board] and the selectors,” Shakib told reporters ahead of Friday’s second India-Bangladesh Test in Kanpur. “They agreed with me, that they are trying to organise everything if possible, so that I can go back to Bangladesh play those two Test matches in Mirpur and finish my Test career there.” He added: “If that doesn’t happen maybe this is my last one [Test match].” The South Africa tour due to start on October 21 is still under a cloud, with the Proteas assessing whether Bangladesh is safe enough after last month’s revolution. Shakib said that next year’s ICC Champion’s Trophy in Pakistan would be his last international outing. “I have eight games to go in ODIs and the Champions Trophy will be last,” he said. He confirmed that he had already called time on his T20 career following the World Cup in June. “This is the right time for me to move on and BCB will look into some new players,” he added. Shakib is arguably the South Asian nation’s greatest cricketer and one of the sport’s greatest all-rounders with more than 700 wickets and nearly 15,000 runs to his name in international cricket. He was the driving force behind the Bangladesh team’s rise to become serious international contenders, enthralling fans through both star turns and scandals. He remains the only player to have topped the International Cricket Council’s all-rounder rankings in all three formats simultaneously. The veteran also played a key role in his team’s historic Test series sweep in Pakistan earlier this month and went to England to play county cricket for Surrey before heading to India. His international career, which began in 2006, spans 70 Tests, 247 ODIs and 129 T20 international matches.",2024,9
https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/9/22/classes-resume-at-bangladesh-university-at-heart-of-anti-hasina-protests,9/22/2024,"Students have returned to classes at Bangladesh’s Dhaka University, after a weeks-long shutdown sparked by a student-led uprising that toppled former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. Tens of thousands had demonstrated on the campus and in the surrounding Shahbagh neighbourhood as protests against job quotas morphed into a nationwide struggle to end Hasina’s 15 years of iron-fisted rule.     As the protests swelled in July, authorities shuttered the campus as part of a crackdown on the demonstrations that killed hundreds. Enrolled at the university were several of the top student protest leaders, some of whom were snatched by plainclothes police and held in custody for several days. On Sunday, the lecture halls were full again, with students chatting in groups along tree-covered walkways and buying drinks and snacks at canteens. Classes had started again in all but four or five departments, assistant proctor Mohammad Mahbub Quaisar, who was appointed after previous administrators loyal to Hasina resigned, told the AFP news agency. “Students are attending in a joyous mood,” he said.    Hasina’s government was accused of widespread abuses, including the mass detention and extrajudicial killing of political rivals. More than 600 people were killed in the weeks leading up to Hasina’s removal in early August, according to a preliminary United Nations report that said the toll was “likely an underestimate”. Since her departure for exile in neighbouring India, cabinet ministers and other senior members of Hasina’s party have been arrested, and her government’s appointees have been purged from courts and the central bank. In the leafy streets of the Shahbagh neighbourhood, colourful new murals exhort the public to “destroy the iron doors of prison” and celebrate Bangladesh’s “rebirth”. “It was like we were in an oppressive era when we could not say anything,” said master’s degree student Kalimulla Al Kafi, 25, of the crackdown ordered by Hasina. “Today it feels like I am attending classes with freedom,” he said. “We can express ourselves freely.”   ",2024,9

Playing at his home ground, the MA Chidambaram Stadium in India’s southern Tamil Nadu state, Ashwin followed up his first-day batting heroics (113 runs off 133 balls) by taking 10 wickets across the two Bangladesh innings.

Home captain Rohit Sharma pressed Ashwin into service and the local boy responded by breaking the partnership in his first over of the day. The wily off-spinner lured the batter forward and Yashasvi Jaiswal took a bat-pad catch at short leg to end Shakib’s knock of 25. Left-arm spinner Jadeja had Litton Das caught in the slip and returned to end Shanto’s defiant knock as Bangladesh collapsed in a heap to lose with five sessions to spare. India declared their second innings at 287-4 on day three after centuries from Shubman Gill, who hit an unbeaten 119, and returning Rishabh Pant, who made 109, flattened the opposition. Gill and the left-handed Pant, who is playing his first Test since a serious car crash in December 2022, put on 167 runs for the fourth wicket.

https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2024/9/10/hasina-gone-but-fate-of-bangladeshs-forcibly-disappeared-hangs-in-balance,9/10/2024,"Dhaka, Bangladesh – For Michael Chakma, a Bangladeshi Indigenous rights activist, each day of his five-year detention in a secret prison allegedly run by the country’s military intelligence was harrowing and filled with unending despair. “There was no window and I had no way to tell time, or whether it was day or night. I was in a dark, enclosed space, and when the light was turned on, it was too bright for me to see properly,” the 45-year-old told Al Jazeera. “Most of the time, I was handcuffed and shackled.”     Chakma was among more than 700 persons, including top opposition figures and activists, who were forcibly disappeared by Bangladeshi authorities during the 15-year “autocratic” regime of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina from January 2009 and June 2024, according to Odhikar, a prominent NGO. Of these, 83 victims were later found dead, with some reportedly killed in “crossfire” with security forces, while more than 150 individuals remain missing. Hasina was forced to resign and flee to neighbouring India in July after millions of Bangladeshis, led by university students, launched a nationwide movement to demand her ouster.    An interim government, led by the country’s only Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus, has since taken over and, on August 29, formed a five-member commission, headed by a former high court judge, to probe the disappearances. Chakma was picked up by armed men near capital Dhaka in April 2019 allegedly for his criticism of the Hasina government’s policy on the Chakmas, the largest among Bangladesh’s Indigenous groups, who mainly live in the so-called Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT) in southeastern Bangladesh. The Chakmas are mostly Buddhist and have for decades been resisting a takeover of their land by Bengali settlers in the CHT region. Studies show the Chakma population in CHT came down from 91 percent in 1959 to 51 percent in 1991, as the successive governments backed the settlers, leading to an uprising by the Chakmas in the 1980s. Dhaka’s military response to the uprising saw gross human rights violations against the Chakmas, including widespread arrests, torture, extrajudicial killings and enforced disappearances. During her first term as prime minister in 1997, Hasina signed the CHT Accord, which recognised the rights of the Chakmas over their land, promised more autonomy to them, and ended the decades-long rebellion. Her Awami League party touted it as a landmark deal. But Chakma was among many in his community who continued to criticise the 1997 deal, mainly over the army’s ongoing presence in the CHT region. He was abducted, allegedly by security forces, in 2019.  “My interrogators told me that criticising the CHT Accord amounted to treason because Hasina’s Awami League party is the government and, by extension, the government is the state. Therefore, no one should criticise the actions of Awami League or Sheikh Hasina,” he told Al Jazeera. For five years, Chakma was in a solitary confinement where, he said, he feared he would never see daylight again and would die in the small cell. “I had no idea at all about what was happening outside,” he said. “The prison guards never even told us whether it was day or night.” Last month, however, Chakma was suddenly removed from his cell. He did not know why. “I was terrified. I thought they were going to kill me,” he said. Blindfolded and restrained, he was put in a car and driven all night, as he remained consumed by the thoughts of his imminent death. “I was whispering to myself: ‘They’re going to kill me, they’re going to kill me,'” he said, dreading a staged “crossfire” execution – a method he had long opposed during his activism for Chakma rights. “When I was in that car, I was hoping they would at least kill me in an open area, allowing me a final glimpse of the world,” he said. Instead, the car stopped in a forest in the dead of the night and he heard a voice: “You are free.” “I was instructed to not remove my blindfold for another half an hour,” he told Al Jazeera. When he finally opened his eyes, he found himself surrounded by teakwood trees. Feeling numb and struggling to process his sudden freedom, he wandered in the darkness, uncertain of his location, until he spotted a signpost that said: “Chattogram Forest Division”. Chittagong was renamed as Chattogram in 2018, but the CHT retains the old name. Realising where he was, Chakma made his way to the highway and managed to hitch a ride with a passing car. “I reached home and was reunited with my siblings. It was an incredibly emotional moment,” he told Al Jazeera. Since Hasina’s fall, at least three victims of enforced disappearances have been returned to their families, including Chakma. The other two are children of prominent leaders of Jamaat-e-Islami, Bangladesh’s largest Muslim party banned by Hasina in 2013 for supporting the Pakistani forces during the country’s liberation war in 1971. The ban was lifted last month by the Yunus-led interim government. Former Brigadier General Abdullahil Aman Azmi is the son of late Jamaat leader, Ghulam Azam, while Mir Ahmad Bin Quasem is the younger son of Mir Quasem Ali, who was among dozens of Jamaat leaders executed by Hasina’s government during a massive crackdown on the Islamist party. Local media reports say Chakma, Azmi and Quasem were detained in Aynaghar (“House of Mirrors”), a notorious network of secret prisons operated by the military intelligence. These prisons were first revealed in 2022 when Netra News, a Sweden-based investigative website, interviewed two of its former detainees. One of those detainees was former Lieutenant Colonel Hasinur Rahman, who spent two years in the secret prison. “I was targeted for my social media posts in which I strongly criticised the Hasina government for its corruption and violence,” Rahman, a decorated army officer, told Al Jazeera. “It’s not just one place. There are several secret prisons collectively referred to as Aynaghar. These are essentially a network of secret facilities run by army intelligence for holding high-value political and other prisoners,” he said. Mubashar Hasan, a researcher in the Department of Cultural Studies at the University of Oslo, was also held in the same prison for 44 days after his abduction in 2017 from Dhaka. He said the clandestine facilities functioned like fully-operational prisons. Hasan, who was targeted for his critical writings against the Hasina regime, said the secret prison even had a medical facility. “We were regularly examined by doctors who ensured we stayed alive,” he told Al Jazeera. He added that he was ordered to remain silent about his abduction and detention. “They issued a clear and direct threat: not only would they abduct me again, but they would also harm my family members,” said Hasan. Quasem, a lawyer, was picked up by plainclothed police in 2016 and kept in a windowless room, shackled. The constant hum of a large exhaust fan drowned out any sound from outside, he told Al Jazeera. “Our health was regularly monitored. We received decent food, but just enough to keep us alive – nothing more, nothing less,” he said. Despite his efforts to connect with the prison guards through small talk, greetings, and requests, he was informed that their superiors had strictly forbidden them from sharing any information about the outside world. “I would ask the guards for time so that I could pray, but they never answered,” he said. “Occasionally, I would hear muffled voices and screams outside my cell. Slowly, I began to realise there were other prisoners like me. It was a fully operational prison.” Like Chakma, Quasem was also released in the dead of the night, instructed to keep the blindfold for half an hour. He was dropped off near a highway in Dhaka, from where he walked for an hour until he stumbled upon a charity clinic his father had once been a trustee of. A staff member at the clinic recognised him and quickly informed his family, which rushed to reunite with him. “I am feeling lucky that I am alive,” he said. “Inside the prison, I had lost all hope of ever seeing my loved ones again. The conditions were so dehumanising that it stripped away any sense of hope. We felt as though we were living as dead bodies.” For years, the families of the victims of forcibly disappeared suffered the agony of not knowing about the fate of their loved ones. “For eight years, we lived in uncertainty,” septuagenarian Ayesha Khatoon told Al Jazeera about her son Quasem. “We had no idea if Arman [Quasem’s nickname] was alive. Each moment in that limbo felt like an eternity.” Quasem’s wife Tahmina Akter and their two daughters remember the day when a group of men barged into their Dhaka apartment and demanded that Quasem come with them. “Our daughters were crying and clinging to their father’s clothes,” Akter told Al Jazeera. “We had never imagined he would go missing for the next eight years. The agony of not knowing where a loved one is defies description.” When Khatoon was reunited with her son last month, she said it felt surreal. “It felt like a dream, and for a time, I wasn’t sure if it was really happening.” While Chakma and Quasem are back with their loved ones, many families of the forcibly disappeared persons continue to wait for any information about their relatives. On August 10, Mayer Daak, a rights group dedicated to combating enforced disappearances in Bangladesh, submitted a list of 158 missing persons to the Directorate General of Forces Intelligence (DGFI), the military intelligence headquarters. Among those still missing is Ataur Rahman, a member of the main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), who was abducted from Dhaka in 2011. His wife, Nadira Sultana, and their children continue to await his return. Sultana joined other family members of the disappeared in a protest outside the DGFI headquarters in Dhaka on August 11, demanding information about her husband. “My daughter, who has special needs, still believes her father is alive. I told her I would bring him back,” Nadira told Al Jazeera. “My children want their father back and I want my husband back.” Mursheda Begum’s husband, Faruk Hossain, another BNP member, was abducted in 2012. She filed several reports with the police and other security agencies, but received no assistance or information about Hossain. Begum and her two daughters also protested outside the DGFI office, holding photos of Hossain. “Our lives continue to be shrouded in uncertainty,” she told Al Jazeera. Last week, Bangladesh’s interim government led by Yunus signed the accession to the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearances, an international United Nations’ convention aimed at ending the practice. Mayer Daak coordinator Sanjida Islam Tulee praised the government’s decision to address the issue of disappearances under Hasina’s long regime. “The grave injustices of these disappearances must be uncovered and prosecuted,” Tulee told Al Jazeera. “Many families are still waiting for their loved ones to return. They deserve the answers.”",2024,9
https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/9/9/bangladesh-taking-steps-to-extradite-former-pm-hasina-from-india,9/9/2024,"Bangladesh’s International Crimes Tribunal (ICT) says it is taking steps to secure the extradition of ousted leader Sheikh Hasina from neighbouring India. The chief prosecutor of the body said on Sunday that the legal process to bring Hasina back to Bangladesh, to face trial for the deadly violence waged by the authorities before she was unseated by mass protests in August, has started.     Following weeks of protests and a vicious crackdown by authorities, Hasina fled by a military helicopter on August 5 and landed at an airbase near New Delhi seeking refuge. Her presence in India has affected relations between Dhaka and New Delhi, and a diplomatic dispute is possible as Bangladesh moves to bring her back to face trial. Mohammad Tajul Islam, the ICT’s chief prosecutor, said Hasina, accused of ruling the country with an iron fist during her 15-year reign, is being sought for her role in overseeing “massacres” during the uprising. “As the main perpetrator has fled the country, we will start the legal procedure to bring her back,” he told reporters. “Bangladesh has a criminal extradition treaty with India which was signed in 2013, while Sheikh Hasina’s government was in power,” Islam added. “As she has been made the main accused of the massacres in Bangladesh, we will try to legally bring her back to Bangladesh to face trial.” The ICT was set up by Hasina in 2010 to investigate atrocities during the 1971 war of independence from Pakistan. Accused of widespread human rights abuses, including the mass detention and extrajudicial killing of her political opponents, Hasina’s government was brought down as weeks of student-led demonstrations escalated into mass protests. More than 600 people were killed in the weeks leading up to Hasina’s ouster, according to a preliminary United Nations report, suggesting the death toll was “likely an underestimate”.    Hasina, 76, has not been seen in public since fleeing. Dhaka has revoked her diplomatic passport. A clause in the extradition treaty between the two countries states that extradition might be refused if the offence has a “political character”. However, Bangladeshi officials have made it clear that Dhaka will push hard to bring the deposed leader back to face justice. Interim leader Muhammad Yunus, a Nobel Peace Prize winner who took over after the uprising, last week said Hasina should “keep quiet” while exiled in India until she is brought home for trial. “If India wants to keep her until the time Bangladesh wants her back, the condition would be that she has to keep quiet,” Yunus told the Press Trust of India news agency. His government is under significant public pressure to demand her extradition, with anti-India sentiment increasing among the wider population in Bangladesh. The general secretary of the main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir, told Indian media that Hasina must be tried in Bangladesh. The pressure has put India in a tricky position and soured relations between New Delhi and Dhaka.   ",2024,9
https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/9/3/uae-pardons-57-bangladeshis-jailed-for-anti-hasina-protests,9/3/2024,"The president of the United Arab Emirates has pardoned 57 Bangladeshi citizens jailed for holding protests in the Gulf country against their own government. The decision, announced on Tuesday, by President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan “cancels” the sentences of the Bangladeshi nationals, state news agency WAM reported.     They will be released and deported, the report said. Bangladesh’s Sangbad Sangstha news agency, citing a presidential adviser, said all 57 are expected to return home soon. The Bangladeshi expatriates were accused of joining protests in the UAE that mirrored the mass demonstrations against the then prime minister, Sheikh Hasina, and her government in their home country. A federal court in the UAE, which bans unauthorised protests, swiftly convicted the Bangladeshis in July of “gathering and inciting riots”. The prosecution had charged them with “crimes of gathering in a public place and protesting against their home government with the intent to incite unrest”. Three people received life sentences and 53 were sentenced to 10 years in prison. One Bangladeshi, who state media said had entered the UAE illegally and “participated in the riot”, was sentenced to 11 years. Human Rights Watch described them as being “arbitrarily detained, convicted and sentenced to long prison terms … based on their participation in peaceful demonstrations”. Sheikh Mohamed’s move to pardon the prisoners comes less than a week after he spoke with Bangladesh’s new interim leader, Muhammad Yunus, who took over after Hasina was toppled from power and fled to India amid last month’s protests That unrest in Bangladesh began in June with student-led protests against civil service job quotas. It escalated into mass demonstrations calling for Hasina, who had been in power since 2009, to quit.    Bangladeshis form the third biggest expatriate group in the country, after Pakistanis and Indians, according to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Most of the population in the country of some 10 million people are foreign residents. Many Bangladeshis in the UAE work in low-paid blue-collar jobs and send remittances home to help support their families. The UAE has little tolerance for dissent as it prohibits criticism of rulers or speech deemed to create or encourage social unrest. Freedom of expression is restricted. The country’s penal code also criminalises offending foreign states or jeopardising ties with them.",2024,9
https://www.aljazeera.com/sports/2024/9/3/bangladesh-beat-pakistan-by-six-wickets-to-wrap-historic-series-win,9/3/2024,"Bangladesh’s cricket team have sealed a historic 2-0 Test series win against Pakistan after securing a six-wicket victory in the second and final match of the tour. Set 185 to win in Rawalpindi, the tourists chased down their target in the afternoon session of the final day on Tuesday to build on the 10-wicket win in the opening Test at the same venue. That match marked in itself Bangladesh’s first Test win against Pakistan.     Zakir Hasan powered 40 off only 39 balls at the top of the innings in Bangladesh’s successful chase to ensure there was little hope of a Pakistani comeback. The 26-year-old’s innings included three fours and two sixes in an opening stand of 58 with Shadman Islam. The winning moment came, perhaps fittingly, with a cover drive off Abrar Ahmed by Shakib Al Hasan, who shared an unbeaten fifth-wicket stand of 32 with Mushfiqur Rahim to settle any nerves after Mominul Haque fell with the score on 153-4. “It means a lot, can’t express with words. Really happy. Before we came, we were looking to win here. Everyone did their job. Very happy,” Bangladesh captain Najmul Hossain Shanto said. Bangladesh’s first innings was rescued by Litton Das’s 136 in a partnership of 165 for the seventh wicket with Mehidy Hasan Miraz after his side were reduced to 26-6 in reply to the hosts’ 274. Mehidy’s 78 followed a five-wicket haul with the ball. Pakistan, who saw three batters reach half-centuries in their first innings, were bowled out for 172 in their second knock as the batting woes of the first match came back to haunt them. Hasan Mahmud was the chief tormentor with 5-43 while Nahid Rana claimed 4-44. “It’s a big achievement by the Bangladesh cricket team. I am part of this, so I am very happy,” wicketkeeper Litton said, reflecting on the match after his own crucial innings with the bat. “When Miraz and I were batting, the credit actually goes to Miraz because the way he faced 20 balls, and if he hits five or six fours, the game will be easier. “We just had conversations like this. They had good momentum. We had to kill that momentum. And let’s see what happens next. And after lunch, we just felt free and just went and batted.” The two defeats in the series extend Pakistan’s barren run in red-ball cricket at home to six losses and four draws since their victory against South Africa at Rawalpindi in 2021.",2024,9
https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2024/9/1/why-was-my-child-killed-parents-grieve-a-month-after-bangladesh-clashes,9/1/2024,"Dhaka, Bangladesh – In the early afternoon of July 19, four-year-old Abdul Ahad was on the balcony of his family’s toy-strewn, rented apartment in Rayerbag neighbourhood when he saw a commotion on the street. Abdul, loud, curious and always asking questions, called out to his father.     “Dad, look. Look what is happening,” he said to his father, Abul Hasan. Abul peered down at the street below. The street, lined with tall apartment buildings, was usually filled with pedestrians, vegetable vendors, rickshaws and children playing cricket on the pavement. But it was a weekend and a curfew had been imposed that day following recent protests and clashes, and the street was quieter than usual. Abul, 33, and his wife, Sumi Akhter, 26, joined Abdul on the balcony. Abdul’s older brother, Matubbar, 11, the quieter of the two siblings, was at his religious school where he lives and studies. “There were clashes between two groups,” Abul recounts. A group of about 10 young people – likely student protesters – were throwing stones at a larger group of young men, widely believed to be supporters of the then-ruling Awami League party, who held sticks and other objects. “I couldn’t see clearly from the eighth floor what objects those were,” Abul says. Abul does not recall any police presence. Mobile footage taken in the neighbourhood shown on Bangladeshi news channel Rtv shows at least one man in the larger group aiming with a gun. Abul remembers hearing people shouting and the distinct sound of gunshots. Abdul fell to the ground. In early July, students in Bangladesh had began peaceful protests against the reinstatement of a controversial job quota system, which reserved nearly one-third of positions for people whose ancestors fought in the 1971 war for independence. By mid-July, the protests had turned violent as the government of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina cracked down, deploying police and other armed forces while members of the Chhatra League, the Awami League’s student wing, who were sometimes armed, attacked and clashed with student protesters. That day the clashes reached Abul’s family. At first, Abul thought his son had slipped and fallen, but then he saw blood on his face, head and shoulder. He had been shot in the right eye. Sumi, his mother, started to scream. “The floor was covered with blood. I don’t know where the bullet came from. My world went dark at that moment,” Abul recalls, his voice choked with grief. Abul remembers rushing to lift Abdul and getting him into the lift with Sumi. As they carried Abdul out of the building, the clashes had already dispersed and people on the street rushed to help them find one of the few autorickshaws on the street. Abdul was barely conscious. As the vehicle sped to the hospital, Abul held his son tightly, praying and crying. At some point, the police stopped them and Abul had to plead to let them continue. Once at the hospital, Abdul was immediately operated on then kept on life support in the intensive care unit (ICU). All Abul and Sumi could do was wait anxiously outside the ICU with their eldest son, Matubbar, who had joined them. The next evening, at about 8:30, a doctor emerged from the ICU to tell them Abdul had died. “My child was not safe in my own home,” says Abul, as he sits in the family’s dining room, his voice breaking. “Why did an innocent child have to die?” He continues: “I am a government employee. My grandfather was a freedom fighter. My child was innocent.” Abul went to his ancestral village of Pukuria to bury his son. He has returned to an empty, quiet house and keeps half expecting to see Abdul, who loved lollies, chips and chicken, on his chair at the dining table or in his usual spot in front of the television. Abdul’s death has splintered the family. Sumi cannot bear to return home without their son and is staying with relatives, nor can she bring herself to be around her other son, who reminds her of the child she lost. Matubbar, meanwhile, is traumatised by his brother’s death and is staying with other relatives. Now, Abul stares blankly at Abdul’s toys—his favourite collection of small cars, motorbikes, jeeps, robots and stuffed animals. “I like to see my son’s favourite cars scattered around the house,” Abul says, heartbroken. “We left them as they were to preserve his memory.” According to UNICEF, at least 32 children were killed during the July protests in Bangladesh. Local media reports suggest that nearly three times that number of children were killed. On August 5, following the new demands of the protesters, Hasina, who after 15 years in power was facing accusations of growing authoritarianism from rights groups and critics, resigned and fled the country. A preliminary report from the United Nations suggests that more than 600 people may have been killed in the unrest and in the immediate aftermath of Hasina’s resignation. Those killed were largely student protesters and bystanders but also journalists and members of the security forces. The report attributes most killings and injuries to the security forces and the Chhatra League. The UN report notes that “police and paramilitary forces appear to have frequently used force indiscriminately” against both peaceful protests and ones with elements of violence – sometimes with protesters holding sticks or bricks – and employed “rubber bullets, sound grenades firearms with live lethal ammunition”. Al Jazeera spoke to several families of children who were shot and killed during the unrest. None of them knows who killed their children. Ijajul Islam, the executive director of the Human Rights Support Society (HRSS), closely monitored the student movement. His organisation collated information through volunteers and news stories about those killed during the protests and are pushing for a proper investigation and accountability. New reports and accounts suggest that “almost all the children were shot dead by the indiscriminate firing of the security forces, mostly by the police”, Islam says. On the afternoon of July 20, 10-year-old Hossein Mia wanted to go out and play in the field at the end of a street near his home in the Muktinagar area of Chittagong Road, a residential neighbourhood in central Dhaka. There had been protests in his neighbourhood since July 15. Hossein, who left school after class three to work as a street hawker selling children’s books, popcorn and juice to support his family, was bored from being stuck at home. The protests had disrupted his work and his mother, Maleka Begum, 30, was concerned about recent violence in the area and wanted Hossein to stay home that day. “Ma, I am just a kid. Who will shoot me?” she remembers Hossein telling her. Though worried, she finally agreed, knowing that her son often played in the same field and that afternoon seemed peaceful compared with previous days. She told Hossein to return in an hour. Hossein left at about 4:30pm. But when the hour passed, he still hadn’t returned. By then the situation in the neighbourhood had changed dramatically. Hossein’s father, Manik Mia, 35, a pickle vendor, went to search for his son, alarmed by what was happening outside – there was now tear gas smoke everywhere, police getting out of vehicles and the sound of gunshots. Manik ran, dodging people who were running. He didn’t see any student protesters on the street. “Everyone was running,” Manik recalls, speaking outside the family’s single-storey home with walls of metal sheeting. “I saw police firing here and there, and there was smoke from tear gas everywhere.” But when he reached the street that led to the field where Hossein had gone to play, police officers and several vehicles blocked the road. Manik was afraid of approaching the police, fearing an aggressive response. Even if he could not enter the field, Manik went to other fields, the market, and to neighbours to ask about Hossein. Two hours passed before he returned home. He and Maleka then went out, leaving their two daughters, aged eight and six, at home. By then, the police had gone and they were able to check the field but found no sign of their son. There were now others on the streets looking for missing family members. Pictures of the wounded and dead were being shared on social media and people in the neighbourhood were sharing updates and trying to help those around them locate their family members. The couple was frantic at this point. As they asked people on the streets about Hossein, a man came up to them to try to help. He showed them pictures of people from the area who had been injured. They were devastated to see one that showed Hossein with a bloodied waist. The man told them that injured people had been taken to Dhaka Medical College Hospital so Maleka and Manik rushed to get there. Manik did not have money as he did not work that day and he and Maleka had to persuade a pick-up driver and then a rickshaw driver to take them part of the way. They also walked for some of the distance to the hospital, eventually arriving after midnight, more than two hours after they set out. The hospital was overwhelmed. They asked around about their son but all they could do was wait for news. Manik and Maleka believed Hossein was receiving treatment, as doctors on duty had mentioned that many people from the Chittagong Road area were being treated for gunshot wounds. Though worried, they were hopeful. They waited in the hallway of the hospital, sitting and pacing. They prayed and reassured one another: “Not to worry, Hossein will be safe.” There were many families looking for their loved ones and volunteers helped direct them to different wards or in some cases the morgue. At about 2am, a man asked who they were waiting for and when Manik told him about Hossein, the man brought them to the morgue. They found Hossein lying there among other bodies. Manik froze, then broke down in tears. Hossein had been shot twice, in the back and hip, Manik says. “I am a poor man. Who will give me justice for my son’s killing?” Manik asks, calling his son his “heart”. “He was my only son,” Maleka says crying. Six-year-old Riya Gop had boundless energy and an infectious laugh. She would dash from room to room, feet pattering, and dart up the stairs to the rooftop to play with dolls with other children. Her cheerfulness was known among her neighbours, who adored her. “My daughter looked like a doll,” her father, Deepak Kumar Gop, says of his only child, who had a round face, wide eyes and a ponytail. On the afternoon of July 19, Riya was playing with some family members and other children on the roof of the four-storey apartment building where they lived in Narayanganj, a residential neighbourhood dotted with trees and tangled wires and plants crowding the rooftops above. When clashes broke out in the streets, Deepak rushed to the rooftop to take Riya. He took her in his arms and as he headed towards the stairs, Riya collapsed onto her father’s shoulder. A bullet had hit her in the back of her head. Deepak rushed Riya to a local hospital where she was referred to Dhaka Medical College Hospital the same day. There, Riya underwent surgery to remove the bullet, and in the days that followed, her neighbourhood prayed for her swift recovery, Deepak says. She remained unconscious and was kept under observation, with her parents by her side the entire time. Five days later, Riya died. “My child was born after many years of marriage. We had to wait so long for her arrival,” says Deepak, choking back tears while speaking to Al Jazeera over the phone. Deepak and his wife, who declined to share her name, both in their thirties, are unable to make sense of the loss of their daughter. “Who will give me justice? What’s the point of talking when my child has already been killed? Why was my child killed?” Deepak asks, his voice trembling. On the same day that Abdul and Riya were killed, 11-year-old Safqat Samir sat at his reading table next to the window in his family’s home in Mirpur Kafrul, a residential area with housing for government employees. Outside, the streets were filled with ongoing protests, which had engulfed the entire neighbourhood. What had started as peaceful demonstrations earlier in the afternoon had quickly escalated as clashes between student protesters and security forces intensified – tear gas filled the air, and the sound of gunfire swept through the street. When tear gas started entering the house in the early evening, Safqat’s uncle, Mashiur Rahman, went to close the second-floor window. A bullet grazed Mashiur’s shoulder then struck Safqat, who was standing behind him, through the right eye. Safqat’s mother and grandmother, who were in another room, rushed the child to hospital but he died on the way. Safqat’s grief-stricken father, Sakibur Rahman, 33, was buying groceries at the time. He recounts seeing a helicopter in the sky and a clash between police and students on the main road in front of Kafrul Police Station. “My wife doesn’t talk to anyone,” Sakibur says, his voice filled with sorrow. “My son was innocent. He dreamt of being a footballer. What was his fault?” On August 8, Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus was sworn in as the chief adviser of the interim government of Bangladesh. A week later, on August 15, UN officials announced that a fact-finding team would be sent to Bangladesh to investigate alleged human rights violations during the protests. With the interim government now in place, there is growing pressure to ensure accountability and justice for the people killed. As the UN prepares to launch its investigation, questions remain about who will be held responsible for the violence and whether the new government will be able to protect the rights of its citizens and deliver justice. Sakibur is unsure whether the government will deliver justice, something he says he could not afford to pursue. “I am from a middle-class family. I can’t afford to go to court cases,” he says. What he thinks about now is how he regrets that he did not take Safqat to the playground when he asked to go, or buy him the toys he wanted. “No father in the world deserves this,” he says. Abdul’s father Abul sits motionless in a dining room chair, surrounded by his son’s toys. “I don’t want anyone innocent to be punished for my child’s death,” he says. “I want a proper investigation.” Still, any answers are unlikely to ease the pain of losing his child. “My world was shattered,” Abul says, his voice shaking, tears in his eyes. “How can anyone compensate for this loss?”",2024,9
https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/8/28/bangladeshs-interim-government-lifts-ban-on-jamaat-e-islami-party,8/28/2024,"Bangladesh’s interim government, led by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus, has lifted a ban on the Jamaat-e-Islami party that was imposed under an antiterrorism law. The Ministry of Home Affairs on Wednesday revoked the ban on the country’s largest Muslim party, put in place in the last days of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina’s administration accusing its members of fomenting unrest during the student uprising that led to her resignation.     A gazette notification issued by the caretaker government said there was “no specific evidence of involvement of Jamaat” and its affiliates “in terrorist activities”. The party had denied allegations that it stoked violence during the protests, which saw students take a stand against a quota system for government jobs, condemning the ban as “illegal, extrajudicial and unconstitutional”. Jamaat-e-Islami, which has millions of supporters, was banned in 2013 from contesting elections after high court judges ruled its charter violated the secular constitution of the Muslim-majority nation of 170 million people. The party was subsequently excluded from successive elections in 2014, 2018 and in January this year, when 76-year-old Hasina won her fifth term in widely discredited polls without a credible opposition. Hasina’s government banned the party on August 1, just four days before she was removed from power after weeks of student-led protests, fleeing to India by helicopter.    Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir, secretary-general of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party, had accused Hasina’s government of trying to divert attention from a crackdown by security forces in which more than 600 people were killed, according to United Nations estimates. Shishir Monir, a lawyer for Jamaat-e-Islami, said the party will file a petition early next week at the Supreme Court to seek restoration of its registration with the Bangladesh Election Commission, so it can go on to contest elections. Jamaat-e-Islami was founded during British colonial rule in 1941, campaigning against the creation of Bangladesh as an independent state during the war of independence from Pakistan in 1971. Most of the party’s senior leaders have been hanged or jailed since 2013, convicted of crimes against humanity, including killings, abductions and rapes, committed in 1971. Bangladesh won independence on December 16, 1971, with the help of neighbouring India.   ",2024,8
https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2024/8/28/i-have-lost-everything-bangladesh-floods-strand-1-24m-families,8/28/2024,"Dhaka, Bangladesh – Ekramul Haque was stunned when his uncle called him late in the afternoon of August 21 to inform him that floodwaters had inundated their ancestral home in southeastern Bangladesh’s Feni district, close to the Indian border. At the time, Haque was about 10km (6 miles) away in the town of Mirsarai in the Chattogram district, where he lives with his wife and children.     The next day, it took 40 minutes travelling by minibus in the downpour to reach his village. “I rushed back to my home the next morning amidst torrential rain. By the time I arrived, knee-deep water had already entered and soaked everything,” the 29-year-old recounted. “I urged my extended family to come with me to Mirsarai.” His parents and one uncle returned to Mirsarai with him. But as the heavy rain continued and reports emerged of floodwaters submerging single-storey homes in his village in Chhagalnaiya Upazila, a district subunit, Haque decided to undertake rescue missions starting on Friday morning to help other family members and residents of the village who were stranded. “I contacted a few friends from university and formed a team to help. However, I was shocked to discover that the road from Mirsarai to Chagalnaiya was entirely submerged under chest-high water, making it completely impassable on Friday,” he said. Haque and his friends initially tried to construct a makeshift raft from felled banana trees, but it failed to float due to the currents. They eventually managed to hire a small boat at three times the usual cost. “The current was very strong, and it took the boatman three hours to navigate us through. When we arrived, nearly all the houses were completely underwater,” Haque told Al Jazeera. The region where Haque grew up doesn’t always experience annual monsoon floods, unlike lower-lying parts of the country. “I don’t recall ever seeing floodwaters rise beyond ankle-deep in my area before in monsoon. My parents mentioned that during the major flood of 1988, the water reached knee-deep. This situation was beyond anything I’ve ever experienced,” he added, speaking by phone while dropping off aid in Chhagalnaiya. Floods in central, eastern and southeastern Bangladesh have killed 23 people and affected more than 5.7 million. About 1.24 million families across 11 districts in the country of 180 million people are stranded, cut off from the rest of the country by floodwaters due to relentless monsoon rains and overflowing rivers. As the floodwaters gradually recede, those affected are urgently in need of food, clean water, medicines and dry clothing. The situation is especially critical in remote areas like Haque’s village, which is not close to the district town and where blocked roads have severely impeded rescue and relief efforts. “We have been working tirelessly to deliver urgent relief to those stranded for the past few days,” Haque said on Tuesday. “Yesterday, we reached a village where people had been without food for 72 hours. Many were severely ill with diarrhoea and lacked clean drinking water. It was an unprecedented crisis.” Bangladesh, located on the Ganges-Brahmaputra Delta, which is the world’s largest, has a deep connection with water. Its landscape, characterised by rivers and floodplains, is accustomed to annual monsoon floods, particularly in the low-lying northeastern districts. Residents in these areas are familiar with this cycle and prepare by taking their valuables to relatives in areas that are not flood-prone and stocking up on food and water before the heavy rains and flooding that occur each monsoon season. Bangladesh is one of the world’s most climate-vulnerable countries, and about 3.5 million people are at risk of annual river flooding, according to a 2015 World Bank Institute analysis. But this year’s floods caught many in the southeast off guard. In flood-affected districts such as Feni, Cumilla and Lakshmipur – regions close to the Indian border – many are blaming India, which they said released water from the Dumbur Dam in the state of Tripura in the middle of last week. India has denied opening the sluicegates. The dam, a low structure about 30-metre (100-foot) high, is more than 120km (75 miles) from the Bangladeshi border. It produces electricity that contributes to the grid used by Bangladesh and is built on the Gumti River, which merges with the Meghna in Bangladesh. Tripura is also facing severe flooding, with 31 people reported dead and more than 100,000 residents displaced into relief camps. Floods and landslides have affected nearly 1.7 million people in India. Kamrul Hasan Nomani, 41, a resident of Lakshmipur, told Al Jazeera that the floodwater is knee-deep in his home and has damaged a large part of it. He believes that no amount of rain could have caused chest-deep water in his village without the dam opening. For Nomani, like many affected by the flooding, the crisis has generated anti-Indian sentiment with many believing that India purposefully opened the dam without warning. “They did it intentionally because their preferred government, led by [former Prime Minister Sheikh] Hasina, has fallen in Bangladesh,” Nomani alleged. On August 5, after massive student-led protests, Hasina’s 15-year rule came to an abrupt end. Hasina, who was widely seen as New Delhi’s favoured leader in Bangladesh, sought refuge in India. The anti-India sentiment that existed while Hasina was prime minister, fuelled by allegations of Indian interference to keep her in power, has escalated since she fled to India. India cited excessive rainfall as the cause of the flooding while acknowledging that on August 21, a flood-related power outage and communications failure prevented sending the usual river updates to their neighbours downstream in Bangladesh. Shafiqul Alam, press secretary for Muhammad Yunus, the Nobel Peace Prize laureate leading Bangladesh’s new interim government, told reporters in Dhaka that Pranay Verma, India’s high commissioner to Bangladesh, informed the interim government that the water from the dam was “released automatically” due to elevated levels. Sardar Uday Raihan, an executive engineer at the Flood Forecasting and Warning Centre in Bangladesh, told Al Jazeera that the agency usually gets information about rising water levels in rivers in India twice a day. “However, this time, India did not share any updates. Without accurate information, it’s hard to give an accurate flood forecast,” he said, adding that timely warnings could have helped prevent deaths and damage. Mohamad Khalequzzaman, a professor of geology at Lock Haven University in the United States, told Al Jazeera that the last flood that inundated districts like Feni, Cumilla or Lakshmipur was in 1988. “The primary cause of this year’s flooding appears to be unusual rainfall in the region, but several other factors have exacerbated the situation,” he explained. He noted that rainfall from August 20 to Friday ranged from 200mm to 493mm (8-19.4 inches), compared with the usual 120-360mm (4.7-14.2 inches) in various locations in Tripura and eastern Bangladesh, which he described as unusually “heavy” for that region during the monsoon. Khalequzzaman added that while the sudden release of dam water during an already severe flood period may have contributed to flooding in the Gomati River watershed, it is unlikely to have contributed significantly to flooding in Feni town, Sonagazi and Chhagalnaiya Upazilas because they do not lie in the river catchment area. He further explained that with the soil of the watershed area already saturated, most of the rainwater turns into surface run-off, leading to flooding of nearby rivers in the affected districts. He also pointed out that unplanned urbanisation over the years has led to a build-up of silt, which, along with roads, buildings and embankments, particularly along the Gomati and Muhuri rivers, prevent floodwaters from receding. Additionally, he said, land encroachment by illegal businesses using the Gomati and Feni rivers for transportation, for example, has destroyed much of the natural drainage system in these areas. “The combination of torrential rain, disruptions in river flow both in India and Bangladesh, loss of natural drainage, riverbed siltation and impediments to surface flow have all contributed to the severe flooding,” he said. In a still-flooded village in Cumilla, the home of Abdul Matin, a teacher, has been destroyed. “I have lost everything. My corrugated tin house has been washed away. I’m unsure how I’ll cope with the financial devastation caused by the flood,” Matin said. He does not believe the flooding was solely caused by heavy rainfall and damage to the natural drainage system. “I hold India responsible for this,” he said. “This was India’s water.” Ismail Mridha, a 46-year-old farmer from Sonagazi Upazila in Feni, told Al Jazeera that the flood devastated his home and farmland. “My house, made of mud and corrugated tin, has been completely destroyed, and the farmland where I grew eggplant and bottle gourd has been washed away,” he said. “I survived the flood, but I am uncertain how I will manage to recover from the financial devastation.”",2024,8
https://www.aljazeera.com/sports/2024/8/27/bangladesh-cricketers-rally-round-murder-accused-teammate-shakib-al-hasan,8/27/2024,"Bangladesh’s cricketers have rallied round teammate Shakib Al Hasan, the ousted lawmaker who faces a case of murder connected to unrest that toppled the government earlier this month. Captain Najmul Hossain Shanto said his team’s maiden Test win against Pakistan on Sunday, in which all-rounder Shakib took three wickets in the second innings, was a tribute to the hundreds killed during protests that forced former premier Sheikh Hasina from power.     Bangladesh endured weeks of student-led protests that resulted in Hasina fleeing to India by helicopter on August 5, ending 15 years of rule. Shakib, 37, who lost his job as a lawmaker for Hasina’s Awami League party when parliament was dissolved, is “a big asset of our country”, said Shanto in a post on Facebook late Monday. “He’s been raising the name of Bangladesh in the world for 17 long years,” Shanto said. Rafiqul Islam, the father of one of the hundreds killed during the civil unrest, filed a murder case against Shakib and 155 others in Dhaka on August 22. Hasina’s government was accused of widespread abuses, including the mass detention and extrajudicial killing of political opponents. Hasina, her former ministers and other ex-lawmakers are also among the accused. Shakib has not spoken publicly about the case, but his teammates said they were offering him support. “Such a case against Shakib bhai [brother] is unexpected,” Shanto added. “In the new Bangladesh, we all want to see something new. I hope all the darkness will pass off and new light will come.” Veteran batsman Mushfiqur Rahim said on Facebook: “I have said it many times before, and I will say it again, I am proud to play alongside a champion like Shakib. “As a teammate and a brother, I will be there during his tough times, and I do not support the false allegations made against him because I know he would never engage in inhumane actions.” Shakib’s inclusion in the side was met with criticism and protests earlier in August. The interim government gave permission for Shakib, who has not commented on the political crisis, to feature in the series. Earlier on Sunday, Shanto dedicated the win to the people who lost their lives during the protests. “We are paying tribute to the individuals who recently passed away in our nation during the protests and praying for their souls,” Shanto said after the match.

Captain, Bangladesh team | #BCB #Cricket #Bangladesh #PAKvBAN #WTC25 pic.twitter.com/d9P3ZZGXtL — Bangladesh Cricket (@BCBtigers) August 25, 2024  Shakib is Bangladesh’s key all-rounder with 4,520 runs in 68 Tests and 2,241 wickets as a spinner, the highest for any Bangladesh bowler in Test cricket. However, he has been embroiled in controversies and cricket rule violations in the past – ranging from bans over corruption to suspensions related to on-field behaviour. People in Dhaka protested against Shakib’s inclusion in the team, with former Bangladesh Cricket Board member Rafiqul Islam criticising him for staying silent as protesters died in clashes with security forces. Shakib joined the squad in Pakistan after featuring in the Global T20 Canada league, where Bangladeshis also chanted slogans against him. The unrest in Dhaka stopped the team from assembling for practice sessions. The tourists got some reprieve after the Pakistan Cricket Board invited them to arrive four days early to make up for their lack of preparations. Bangladesh achieved their first victory over Pakistan in 14 Tests with a thumping 10-wicket win on Sunday after both teams struggled in hot conditions on a flat Rawalpindi pitch. Shakib scored 15 runs and took four wickets in the match. He was handed a fine and a demerit point following the Test win as the match referee found that he had breached the game’s code of conduct by throwing a ball over the head of Pakistan’s Mohammad Rizwan while waiting to bowl to him. The second and final Test will also be played in Rawalpindi from Friday.",2024,8
https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/8/25/enough-is-enough-rohingya-demand-end-to-violence-in-myanmar,8/25/2024,"Tens of thousands of Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh have held rallies in camps to mark the seventh anniversary of the military crackdown in Myanmar that forced them to flee. Refugees from children to the elderly waved placards and chanted slogans on Sunday in the camps in Cox’s Bazar, demanding an end to violence and their safe return to Myanmar.     Many also wore ribbons bearing the words “Rohingya Genocide Remembrance”. “Hope is home” and “We Rohingya are the citizens of Myanmar,” their placards read. “Enough is enough. Stop violence and attacks on the Rohingya community,” refugee Hafizur Rahman told the Reuters news agency. The Rohingya, a mostly Muslim minority, have long been a target of discrimination and ethnic violence in Myanmar. In 2017, at least 750,000 Rohingya fled to neighbouring Bangladesh after the Myanmar military launched a crackdown that is now the subject of a genocide case at the International Court of Justice in The Hague. In recent weeks, thousands more Rohingya have reportedly fled western Myanmar’s Rakhine state to Bangladesh as fighting escalates between the military regime and the Arakan Army, a powerful ethnic armed group that recruits from the Buddhist majority. The international medical group Doctors without Borders, known by its French acronym MSF, said its teams in Cox’s Bazar treated 39 people for conflict-related injuries, including mortar shell and gunshot wounds, in the four days leading up to August 7. More than 40 percent of the injured were women and children, it added in a statement. UNICEF has also raised alarm over the worsening situation in Rakhine, citing increasing reports of civilians, especially children, being caught in the crossfire. It said that seven years after the exodus from Myanmar, “about half a million Rohingya refugee children are growing up in the world’s largest refugee camp”. “We want to return to our homeland with all the rights. The United Nations should take initiatives to ensure our livelihood and peaceful coexistence with other ethnic communities in Myanmar,” refugee Mohammed Taher said. Meanwhile, Bangladesh’s de facto foreign minister in its interim government, Mohammad Touhid Hossain, told the Reuters news agency this month that other countries neighbouring Myanmar, such as India, should do more. Hossain also called for more international pressure on the Arakan Army to stop attacking the Rohingya in Rakhine state. Orla Murphy, MSF’s country representative in Bangladesh, said in a statement there is also a need to immediately protect civilians caught up in the conflict in Myanmar. “People must not come under indiscriminate attack and should be allowed to leave for safer areas, while all those in need of vital medical care should have unhindered and sustained access to medical facilities,” Murphy said. Myanmar was plunged into uncertainty in February 2021 when the military seized power from the elected government of Aung San Suu Ky. The power grab triggered mass demonstrations against military rule that evolved into an armed uprising when the military responded with force.",2024,8

Off-spinner Mehidy Hasan Miraz and left-arm spinner Shakib Al Hasan, who was a lawmaker from former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina’s Awami League, shared seven wickets after the pace bowlers mopped up the top order to give Bangladesh its maiden win in 14 Test matches against Pakistan on Sunday afternoon.     The visiting team’s captain, Najmul Hossain Shanto, dedicated the win to the people who lost their lives during the recent political protests against Hasina and her government. “We are paying tribute to the individuals who recently passed away in our nation during the protests and praying for their souls,” Shanto said after the match. “It’s an amazing feeling and really a special moment for us,” Shanto added. More than 450 people were killed in Bangladesh from the start of a police crackdown on student protests against Hasina in July to her ouster on August 5. “Over the last one month, we had a difficult [political] situation, but this win will bring a little bit of smile,” the 26-year-old said with a big smile on his own face. “It’s a historic day for us [to win the first Test match against Pakistan].

PC: PCB#BCB #Cricket #BDCricket #Bangladesh #PAKvBAN #WTC25 pic.twitter.com/yqNmaQ6rsL — Bangladesh Cricket (@BCBtigers) August 25, 2024  Bangladesh’s opening batters, Zakir Hasan and Shadman Islam, were unbeaten on 15 and 9, respectively, as the visitors reached 30-0 at the stroke of the tea interval for only their seventh away Test win. Pakistan, who conceded a 117-run first innings lead despite declaring at 448-6, were bowled out by a disciplined pace and spin attack after they resumed on 23-1 and still 94 runs behind. Mohammad Rizwan followed his career-best unbeaten 171 to top-score with 51 but most of his teammates were guilty of falling to rash shots coupled with some aggressive field placings by Shanto. Mehidy picked up 4-21 and Shakib 3-44 while the three fast bowlers – Shoriful Islam, Hasan Mahmud and Nahid Rana – snared one wicket each. “It’s really nice the way everyone showed character in such hot conditions,” Shanto said, praising his batters for posting a formidable score of 565 in the first innings. “We knew if we bowled in right areas, we can win this game, … and today, both Shakib and Miraz used the conditions very well.” Veteran wicketkeeper-batter Mushfiqur Rahim was named player of the match for his 191-run innings in Bangladesh’s first innings. Upon accepting the award in the post-match ceremony, Rahim called the innings one of his “finest performances”. The 37-year-old said he would donate his prize money to people  affected by the past week’s floods in Bangladesh. “I want to request all the people back home, those who can, [to] donate and also help in this cause,” Rahim said. In a dramatic first session, Bangladesh set up their victory as Pakistan limped to 108-6 and lost five wickets. Captain Shan Masood (14) was dismissed in the second over of the day when Hasan found a faint edge and had the Pakistan skipper caught behind. Hasan should have had Babar Azam out for a pair of ducks in the game, but wicketkeeper Litton Das spilled a simple catch off the first ball Babar faced. Babar tried to break the shackles and hit three boundaries before he was out to fast bowler Rana (1-30) when on 22. Pakistan’s middle-order batters were guilty of throwing away their wickets against the two spinners, Shakib and Mehidy. The defeat extended Pakistan’s barren run in red-ball cricket at home to five losses and four draws since it last beat South Africa at Rawalpindi in 2021. “We have to look upon the mistakes we’ve made collectively and work on them,” Masood said after losing his fourth successive Test match since he was named Test captain before a series in Australia late last year. “I apologise to the whole nation and hope we will do much better in the next game.” The second Test will also be played at Rawalpindi from next Friday after it was moved from Karachi due to ongoing construction work at the National Bank Stadium.",2024,8
https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/8/23/hundreds-of-thousands-stranded-as-floods-hit-india-and-bangladesh,8/23/2024,"Floodwaters have inundated parts of India and Bangladesh, stranding hundreds of thousands of people in India’s northeast and neighbouring Bangladesh’s eastern region. The death toll in Bangladesh, which is still recovering from weeks of political turmoil, had risen to 13 on Friday.     Some 4.5 million people were affected by the floods in eastern Bangladesh, the Ministry of Disaster Management and Relief said. Soldiers in lifeboats ferried people to safety in India’s northeastern state of Tripura on Friday after heavy rains triggered floods and landslides, forcing more than 65,000 people from their homes and killing at least 23 people, the authorities said. Television images showed army personnel manning the rescue craft, while cars and buses were marooned in streets of knee-deep water, and disaster management officials said four days of incessant rain had swollen rivers. The authorities have opened 450 relief camps in Tripura, where about 1.7 million people have been affected, along with extensive damage to infrastructure, crops and livestock. The rains and the rising waters from upstream Tripura devastated many areas in eastern Bangladesh. Many in the worst-hit districts such as Cumilla, Feni and Noakhali called for rescue as power was cut and road links were disconnected. Travel and communications were severed between the capital, Dhaka, and the southeastern port city of Chittagong as parts of a major highway were underwater. While annual monsoon rains in South Asia regularly cause significant destruction, climate change is altering weather patterns and increasing the frequency of extreme weather events. “It’s a catastrophic situation here,” rescue volunteer Zahed Hossain Bhuiya, 35, told the AFP news agency from Feni. “We are trying to rescue as many people as we can.” Nur Islam, a shopkeeper in Feni, said his home had been completely submerged. “Everything is underwater,” the 60-year-old said. Bangladesh’s disaster management ministry said in a bulletin that the latest toll of 13 deaths included fatalities in cities along the country’s southeastern coast. That included Chittagong and Cox’s Bazar, a district home to about a million Rohingya refugees from neighbouring Myanmar. Nearly 190,000 others were taken to emergency relief shelters, according to the bulletin. Political controversy While both the neighbours have been affected by the floods, many Bangladeshis blamed India, saying it opened a river dam in Tripura, causing sudden floods in Bangladesh. India’s Ministry of External Affairs denied that in a statement, saying the dam is far from the border and that India had seen the “heaviest rains of this year” this week, and that the flow of water downstream was due to “automatic releases”. Tripura state’s main river, Gomti, was flowing above the danger mark, government officials said. The Gomti flows through the district of Cumilla in Bangladesh to empty into the Bay of Bengal. India and Bangladesh share 54 common rivers that flow from the Himalayas to the Bay of Bengal.",2024,8
https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/8/18/bangladeshs-yunus-promises-support-to-rohingya-in-first-policy-speech,8/18/2024,"Muhammad Yunus, the interim leader of Bangladesh, has delivered his first major government policy address in which he promised to support the Rohingya community seeking refuge in the country and maintain Bangladesh’s garment trade. Setting out his priorities in front of diplomats and UN representatives on Sunday, Yunus pledged that his government “will continue to support the million-plus Rohingya people sheltered in Bangladesh”.     “We need the sustained efforts of the international community for Rohingya humanitarian operations and their eventual repatriation to their homeland, Myanmar, with safety, dignity and full rights,” he said. Bangladesh is home to about one million Rohingya. Most of them fled neighbouring Myanmar in 2017 after a military crackdown now the subject of a genocide investigation by a United Nations court. Earlier this month, medical charity Doctors without Borders, known by its French initials MSF, said that more Rohingya are arriving in Bangladesh from Myanmar with war-related injuries amid escalating conflict between the military and the rebel Arakan Army (AA) in western Rakhine State. More than 40 percent of the injured were women and children, it added in a statement.    Yunus, an 84-year-old Nobel Peace Prize-winning economist, returned from Europe this month after he was picked by President Mohammed Shahabuddin to lead an interim government, fulfilling a key demand of the student protest leaders. His predecessor Sheikh Hasina, 76, fled the country on August 5 by helicopter after 15 years in power, brought down by antigovernment protests. The weeks of unrest and mass protests that toppled Hasina also saw widespread disruption to the country’s linchpin textile industry, with suppliers shifting orders out of the country. “We won’t tolerate any attempt to disrupt the global clothing supply chain, in which we are a key player,” Yunus said. Bangladesh’s 3,500 garment factories account for about 85 percent of its $55bn in annual exports.    In his policy address, Yunus also noted how over the past month, “hundreds of thousands of our valiant students and people rose up against the brutal dictatorship of Sheikh Hasina”, and pledged to investigate their deaths. More than 450 people were killed between the start of a police crackdown on student protests and her ouster three weeks later. “We want an impartial and internationally credible investigation into the massacre,” Yunus said on Sunday. “We will provide whatever support the UN investigators need.” A UN fact-finding mission is expected in Bangladesh soon to probe “atrocities” committed during the student-led protests. Yunus has also committed to holding free and fair elections in the near future. Yunus himself was convicted of violating labour laws during the previous administration, in what had been denounced as a politically motivated trial. “The Sheikh Hasina dictatorship destroyed every institution of the country,” Yunus said. He added that his administration would “make sincere efforts to promote national reconciliation”.",2024,8
https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/8/15/bangladesh-protesters-vowing-to-guard-revolution-beat-hasina-supporters,8/15/2024,"Hundreds of student protesters and political activists, vowing to guard Bangladesh’s student-led “revolution”, have attacked the supporters of ousted Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and prevented them from reaching the house of her father, the assassinated independence leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. The rally was called on Thursday by the supporters of Hasina’s Awami League party to mark the anniversary of the August 15, 1975 assassination of Rahman and other members of his family during a military coup. Hasina survived along with her younger sister because they were visiting Germany.     Hasina’s government had declared August 15 a national holiday. But the holiday was cancelled by the interim government led by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus, who took over following Hasina’s downfall. Armed with bamboo sticks, iron rods and pipes and with no police in sight, hundreds of people blocked the entrance to Bangabandhu Memorial Museum, Hasina’s family home in Dhaka’s Dhanmondi area that was turned into a memorial to her father. Rahman is fondly called “bangabandhu”, or a friend of Bengal. The house was torched by the protesters hours after Hasina, 76, resigned and fled to India on August 5 in a dramatic end to her iron-fisted rule of 15 years. Her ouster followed an uprising during which more than 300 people were killed. In her first public statement since her abrupt departure, Hasina asked supporters earlier this week to “pray for the salvation of all souls by offering floral garlands and praying” outside the landmark. But Hasina’s opponents said they will stop the gathering of her supporters as they could attempt to create chaos in the name of commemoration. Overnight, they held a party using loudspeakers and playing songs as they danced outside the museum. “Fugitive and dictator Sheikh Hasina has ordered her goons and militia forces to come to the site so they can produce a counter-revolution,” Imraul Hasan Kayes, 26, told AFP news agency. “We are here to guard our revolution so that it doesn’t slip out of our hands.” Several people that the crowd suspected of being Awami League supporters were thrashed with sticks, while others were forcibly escorted away.  Meanwhile, Bangladesh’s interim government on Thursday announced that the United Nations would probe the “atrocities” committed during the weeks-long protests that ousted Hasina’s government. The announcement followed a phone conversation between Yunus and UN human rights chief Volker Turk on Wednesday, with officials in the interim government saying the UN investigators are likely to arrive next week. Hasina’s government was accused of widespread human rights abuses, including the mass detention and extrajudicial killing of thousands of her political opponents during her 15-year stint in power. Local authorities have also launched investigations into allegations of murders, genocide and crimes against humanity committed by the deposed Hasina, her cabinet colleagues and top security officials.",2024,8

https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/8/13/ex-bangladesh-pm-hasina-demands-probe-into-protest-killings-and-vandalism,8/13/2024,"Bangladesh’s former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has called for action against those involved in “killings and vandalism” in the country last month, her first comments since violent protests forced her to flee to India. More than 300 people died in the demonstrations that began as student-led protests against quotas in government jobs spiralled into a larger movement seeking Hasina’s overthrow.     Hasina’s written statement, issued on X on Tuesday through her United States-based son, came hours after a court ordered a probe into her role in the death of a grocery shop owner during the protests. Many people died “in the name of revolution” in July, Hasina, 76, said. “I demand that those involved in these killings and vandalism be properly investigated and the culprits be identified and punished accordingly,” she said.    The deposed Bangladeshi leader also urged her supporters to appear in public in the capital Dhaka on Thursday to mark the anniversary of her father’s assassination. “I appeal to you to observe the National Day of Mourning on August 15 with due respect and solemnity,” she said in the statement. Thursday marks the anniversary of the 1975 assassination of her father, independence hero Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, during a military coup – a date her government had declared a national holiday. Hasina asked supporters to “pray for the salvation of all souls by offering floral garlands and praying” at her childhood home in Dhaka. The landmark was until recently a museum to her father, but it was torched and vandalised by a mob hours after her fall. The caretaker administration now running Bangladesh said earlier on Tuesday it had cancelled observance of the politically-charged holiday. The murder case against Hasina – the first following the protests – was accepted by Dhaka’s chief metropolitan magistrate’s court after a hearing and the police have been ordered to investigate. Six others accused in the case include Obaidul Quader, the general secretary of Hasina’s Awami League party, former Interior Minister Asaduzzaman Khan Kamal and senior police officials. Prosecutors said grocer Abu Saeed was hit by a bullet while crossing the street on July 19 as police fired on protesters in Dhaka’s Mohammadpur area. The complainant blamed Hasina, who had called for strong action to quell the violence, for the shooting. Lawyer Amir Hamza said he was not related to Saeed but approached the court because Saeed’s family could not afford to file the case. “I am the first ordinary citizen who showed the courage to take this legal step against Sheikh Hasina for her crimes. I will see the case to an end,” Hamza told the Reuters news agency. Other members of her government also face criminal action, with former Law Minister Anisul Huq and Hasina’s adviser Salman F Rahman arrested for allegedly “instigating” the murder of two people, police said on Tuesday. Bangladeshi student leader Nahid Islam, now part of the interim government, said recently that Hasina must face trial for the killings during her term. Hasina plans to return to Bangladesh when the caretaker government decides on holding elections, her son has said.",2024,8
https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2024/8/12/what-does-sheikh-hasinas-resignation-mean-for-india-bangladesh-relations,8/12/2024,"When the deposed Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina fled Dhaka by military helicopter on August 5, following weeks-long deadly protests against her government, there was little doubt about where she was headed. India has supported Hasina and it is where she spent many years in exile after almost her entire family was assassinated in 1975.     When Hasina landed at an air force base near New Delhi, she was received by none other than Ajit Doval, the head of the Indian security establishment who oversees the external intelligence agency, the Research and Analysis Wing (RAW), which has been accused of meddling in the internal affairs of Bangladesh and other neighbouring countries. Hasina resigned after weeks-long protests that killed nearly 300 people. She is reportedly seeking asylum in the West and will likely stay in India for “a while”, according to local Indian media. Bangladesh is currently being led by an interim government under Nobel Peace Prize-winning economist Muhammad Yunus. There are already signs of frostiness between the two neighbours in the wake of Hasina’s resignation. Following her departure, non-essential staff from India’s high commission have been withdrawn from Bangladesh, according to local Indian media. The events that led to Hasina’s overthrow are perceived as a major setback for India, which shared strong diplomatic and trade relations with Dhaka under Hasina, and in whom India had invested a lot in recent years. Hasina had been a valuable ally that helped undo – to some extent – the security, logistical and political nightmare created by the 1947 partition of India and Pakistan. After partition, to India’s east lay East Pakistan, later renamed Bangladesh in 1971 after a bloody war of independence led by Hasina’s father Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. Following the birth of Bangladesh with India’s help, challenges grew for India as the new nation vacillated between a secular democracy and an Islamic republic like Pakistan. India always perceived any shift towards Pakistan’s values as a threat. In the late 1970s, India faced a national security challenge with a Zia on the left and a Zia on the right – meaning Pakistan under General Zia-ul-Haq and Bangladesh led by General Ziaur Rahman. Rahman, who founded the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), was assassinated in 1981. His wife Khaleda Zia ruled the country sporadically until 2006. It was much to India’s relief when in 2009 Hasina and her Awami League party, which represented a secular democracy where minorities like Hindus, Bangladesh’s largest minority faith, felt protected, came to power. In the last 15 years, Hasina rebuilt roads linking Dhaka with Kolkata and Agartala in India that were severed after 1947. She built bridges, re-established railway links and facilitated easy access of cargo ships on the Brahmaputra River and its tributaries, bringing the two countries closer. Security cooperation increased between India and Bangladesh and Hasina helped India quell rebellion in the northeastern Indian state of Assam by refusing to provide safe refuge to rebels from across the border. Although Hasina had an excellent relationship with China, too, she managed to convey to India that its interests came first. She had recently said, for example, that she preferred India over China for a $1bn river development project. However, what really tightened the relationship between India and Bangladesh was a deal struck between Hasina’s government and the Indian Adani Group in the power sector. The agreement would see Bangladesh receive coal-based power from a $1.7bn plant in Jharkhand, India. But the deal generated unease within the opposition, as Bangladesh would be paying higher tariffs than what it would pay for other sources. Moreover, there was disquiet over the deal as any agreement with Adani was also seen to earn favour with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. “It was not a secret to the AL [Awami League] that Adani was closely tied with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and a business deal that favours Adani would ultimately bring political favour from Modi to [the] AL government,” Saimum Parvez, research fellow of the department of political science of Vrije University in Brussels, told Al Jazeera in 2023. India, therefore, recognised the importance of securing its precious ally, Hasina, and her government in Dhaka. Back in January, there were allegations of Indian interference in Bangladesh’s elections to keep Hasina in power. Hasina had become increasingly authoritarian, arresting and targeting opposition members, and cracking down on dissent and free speech. Many observers including the United States said the elections were “not free or fair” given that the main opposition, the BNP, did not participate. When Hasina secured a fifth term in the controversial poll, India, along with Russia and China, congratulated her on her victory. When Bangladesh’s student demonstration against job quotas for the families of freedom fighters turned violent and became a nationwide call for her resignation, the authorities responded with a harsh crackdown. Indian security experts told this journalist on condition of anonymity that the Indian security establishment thought Hasina and her control over the army would ensure that the upheaval would not spin out of control. There had been occasions, however, when India tried to reach out to the opposition so that it was not left on in the cold if Hasina’s government were to be thrown out of office. But according to sources speaking to the Indian Express newspaper, Hasina would not allow any Indian high commissioner to talk to BNP leader Khaleda Zia. Hasina allegedly zealously guarded not just her friends, but also who they spoke to. What many strategic experts on security issues Al Jazeera spoke to, including those in the diplomatic community, were reluctant to say was that much of the harm done to India’s interests was of its own doing. That is, ever since India’s foreign policy was driven by the same forces that are trying to shift India from being a secular constitution-based democracy to one which is guided by the Hindu faith, New Delhi has been losing friends. In 2021, when Modi visited Dhaka, protests against the prime minister erupted leaving at least 12 dead. Bangladeshis were protesting anti-Muslim discrimination in India and policies such as a controversial law which allows a citizenship pathway for minorities but excludes Muslims. “This was the turning point of our relationship with Bangladesh,” a retired intelligence official who did not want to be named said last week. “Local people just got turned off India’s shift away from constitutional secularism.” At the face of it, the biggest worry for the Indian diplomatic establishment would be the return of a right-wing BNP government under Khaleda Zia in Bangladesh that could attempt to marginalise the Awami League. There are fears that such a government could affect the Hindu minority, which accounts for about 8 percent of the country of 170 million and traditionally supports the Awami League. Some Indian news outlets have been pushing claims that Pakistan and China were behind the protests, as well as exaggerating the scale of attacks Hindu minorities have experienced in the wake of the protests. Anti-Muslim coverage has pushed the narrative that Pakistan wants to turn Bangladesh – a Muslim country that upholds secular principles – into an Islamic state. Al Jazeera has independently verified that since Hasina’s removal two Hindus have been killed – a police officer and an Awami League activist – and several Hindu households in the country have been attacked and looted. A Hindu leader told Al Jazeera attacks that have been politically motivated, not communal. Still, there have been numerous reports of attacks targeting Hindu households, temples and businesses. The interim cabinet said its in first official statement on Sunday that attacks “have been noted with grave concern”. It said it would “immediately sit with the representative bodies and other concerned groups to find ways to resolve such heinous attacks”. Student protesters in Bangladesh are trying to prove fears of religious violence unfounded by protecting Hindu temples and houses from being vandalised. Instagram is full of pictures of young students guarding shrines in Dhaka and elsewhere in the country. But any violence targeting Hindus would only help the hardliners in India’s governing BJP who may claim vindication that the Hindus and Muslims cannot live together and justify bringing in the citizenship law. India has a lot riding on Bangladesh, including annual trade worth $13bn. The countries were also due to start talks for a free trade agreement. With Hasina now out, India has lost influence in the country and it would prefer for there to be no elections for now. That may not happen with exiled BNP opposition leader Tarique Rahman due to return to Bangladesh, according to his party. “The time-tested diplomatic response to this should be that we are waiting and watching to see how things will develop and to reiterate our friendly sentiments for the people of a close and important neighbour,” Shyam Saran, the former foreign secretary, said writing in the Indian Express newspaper. Indian political parties are largely with the government on this. At an all-party meeting, the government was given a carte blanche for dealing with the situation in Bangladesh. The big question is: Does the Indian government have a clue what to do next in Dhaka?",2024,8
https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/8/12/more-injured-rohingya-arriving-in-bangladesh-as-myanmar-war-intensifies,8/12/2024,"More Rohingya are arriving in Bangladesh from Myanmar with war-related injuries amid escalating conflict between the military and the Arakan Army (AA) in western Rakhine State, according to international medical group Doctors without Borders, known by its French initials MSF. MSF said its teams in Cox’s Bazar, Bangladesh, treated 39 people for conflict-related injuries including mortar shell injuries and gunshot wounds in the four days leading up to August 7. More than 40 percent of the injured were women and children, it added in a statement.     Staff at its clinic said it was the first time in a year that they had seen serious injuries on such a scale. “Considering the rise in the number of wounded Rohingya patients crossing from Myanmar in recent days, and the nature of the injuries our teams are treating, we are becoming increasingly concerned about the impact of the conflict on Rohingya people,” said Orla Murphy, MSF’s country representative in Bangladesh. “It is clear that safe space for civilians in Myanmar is shrinking more each day, with people caught up in the ongoing fighting and forced to make perilous journeys to Bangladesh to seek safety.” The mostly Muslim Rohingya have long been a target of discrimination and ethnic violence in Rakhine. In 2017, at least 750,000 Rohingya fled into Bangladesh after the Myanmar military launched a brutal crackdown that is now being investigated as a genocide. Many of the thousands who remain continue to live in camps where their movements are restricted. Fighting in the state has escalated in recent months after the AA, which claims to represent Rakhine’s Buddhist majority and is fighting for autonomy, joined armed groups fighting against the military, which seized power in a coup in February 2021. At the end of June, the UK-based Burmese Rohingya Organisation UK (BROUK) warned of an “intensifying genocide” in Rakhine amid fierce fighting in Maungdaw, a coastal town near the Bangladesh border where many Rohingya live. The same month the fighting forced MSF to suspend its health services in northern Rakhine. MSF said the Rohingya seeking its assistance in Bangladesh had told them a “desperate situation” was unfolding in Rakhine. “Some reported seeing people bombed while trying to find boats to cross the river into Bangladesh and escape the violence,” the statement said. “Others described seeing hundreds of dead bodies on the riverbanks. Many patients spoke of being separated from their families en route to safer areas and of loved ones being killed in the violence. Many people said they were fearful that family members remaining in Myanmar would not survive.” A drone attack just outside Maungdaw a week ago killed dozens of people waiting to cross into Bangladesh, the Reuters news agency reported at the weekend. A heavily pregnant woman and her two-year-old daughter were among the victims, it added, with the military and AA each blaming the other for the atrocity. MSF said there was a need to immediately protect civilians caught up in the conflict. “People must not come under indiscriminate attack and should be allowed to leave for safer areas, while all those in need of vital medical care should have unhindered and sustained access to medical facilities,” Murphy said.",2024,8
https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/8/11/new-bangladesh-government-says-working-to-resolve-attacks-on-minorities,8/11/2024,"Bangladesh’s new interim government says it is working to resolve attacks on Hindus and other religious minorities reported after the ouster of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. Hindus are the largest minority faith in mostly Muslim Bangladesh, and many are supporters of Hasina’s party, the Awami League.     Since Hasina’s abrupt resignation and flight abroad on Monday brought an end to her 15 years in power, there have been numerous reports of attacks against Hindu households, temples and businesses. “The attacks on religious minorities in some places have been noted with grave concern,” the interim cabinet said on Sunday in its first official statement since its members were sworn in on Thursday night. The cabinet said it would “immediately sit with the representative bodies and other concerned groups to find ways to resolve such heinous attacks”. Thousands of people participated in protests on Sunday calling for an end to violence against Hindu communities, the Dhaka Tribune reported. Protesters objected to the “destruction of homes, encroachment on temple land, arson, looting, and other forms of violence”, the report said. “We are appalled by the attacks on Hindus, the torture and the vandalism of temples. It is the government’s responsibility to ensure our safety. We are citizens of this country and deserve to live securely,” the Dhaka Tribune quoted a Hindu speaker as saying at a rally in the city of Bogra. The statement from the interim government, also known as the council of advisers, listed numerous urgent priorities. The government, led by Nobel Peace Prize laureate Muhammad Yunus, ordered “support” for the families of protesters who were killed in the weeks of demonstrations culminating in Hasina’s departure. It directed public funds to pay for those injured in the unrest, which began in July and killed more than 300 people. The council, tasked with steering democratic reforms in the South Asian nation of 170 million people, also said it would reopen the metro system in the capital, Dhaka, by the end of the week and soon appoint a new central bank governor, replacing a Hasina loyalist forced to resign.

https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2024/8/10/after-hasina-cautious-optimism-for-bangladeshs-future,8/10/2024,"By all quantifiable measures, Bangladesh’s now deposed Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina was the most entrenched, dominant and brutal dictator the country had seen since its independence. She jailed, exiled and eliminated most of her political peers like no other ruler in South Asia’s history. She brought all the branches of the Bangladeshi state under her command with such great efficacy that at some point she became the state. Yet, a leaderless movement of college students challenged her with marches with pre-announced dates and venues. In a matter of weeks, these young revolutionaries drew the nation with them into the streets to the point that Hasina had to catch a helicopter to flee. They achieved something that established political rivals of the former prime minister had tried for over a decade but failed consistently.     While the young revolutionaries and their supporters have much cause to celebrate, the road ahead for the country will not be without challenges. The beginning of the end for Hasina came as a group of young people started making demands for the removal of an unfair quota system in the distribution of civil service jobs, which was essentially giving preferential treatment to the relatives of her political cronies. In organising their protests, the students created a distributed co-leadership structure, where the leaders held the role of coordinators. They called their coalition the Students Against Discrimination movement. The coordinators came from both public and private educational institutions. What could have been quelled with some simple promises of future reforms was inflamed by crass comments by the prime minister and brutal suppression by her security forces. But the protest organisers were battle-tested and knew exactly what to expect. Just six years ago, many of them had participated as teenagers in another massive wave of demonstrations which focused on the country’s lawless transportation sector. Those protests erupted after a commercial bus ran over two students. The vehicle that caused these deaths was owned by a company linked to a relative of a minister. Just like in 2024, in 2018 the youth were beaten mercilessly by Hasina’s civilian militia, that is, the student wing of the Awami League party. The use of violence managed to suppress the protests, but not before this generation of revolutionaries had gained enough experience in organising successful protests, creating alternative command structures, using improvised communication techniques under internet blockades and evading government surveillance, etc. All of these skills helped them in their successful bid to oust the most ruthless dictator in Bangladesh’s history. Hasina has had to leave Bangladesh before. While she was residing in Europe, a bloody coup took place against her father, President Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, in 1975, which killed almost all of her family. She extended her stay abroad and only came back to the country in the early 1980s. She quickly gained prominence on the political scene and managed to create a cult-like following among the members of her father’s Awami League. Following another military coup in 2006, both Hasina and her main political rival, Khaleda Zia, were about to lose their right to participate in politics in Bangladesh. Zia refused to go into exile and stayed in Bangladesh under house arrest. Hasina took the safe exit and spent time in Europe and the United States before returning to Bangladesh. She contested the 2008 election and won with a landslide. But her triumphant return to power in 2008 is unlikely to be repeated. Given the massive bloodshed and indiscriminate killings that took place throughout her tenure, it will be extremely difficult for the 76-year-old Hasina to revive her political fortunes this time. General Waker Uz Zaman, the military chief who eventually asked Hasina to leave the country, happens to be a relative of hers through marriage. However, the possibility of a successful counter-coup to facilitate her return to Bangladesh is improbable at the moment, given the popular resentment towards her rule. The fact that no other political figure of her stature had ever had to flee the country facing the rage of the people has permanently damaged Hasina’s reputation as an invincible leader.  After all, she was chased away by hundreds of thousands of youths wielding sticks and bricks, while her men had all the guns and were shooting indiscriminately. This inglorious exit will make her future comeback politically untenable. An interim caretaker government headed by one of Hasina’s nemeses, Dr Muhammad Yunus, Bangladesh’s only Nobel laureate, was sworn in on August 8, three days after Hasina fled. Dr Yunus, one of the few prominent political figures who is respected across the nation, will be the chief adviser, a title equivalent to prime minister. The 16-person advisers’ panel (the equivalent to cabinet ministers) that he chose includes civil society luminaries, several of whom had received international accolades. Among the advisers are two leading coordinators from the ranks of the student movement. Dr Yunus and his selected advisers received positive media and public acceptance so far, but they have a difficult job ahead. At the moment, student organisers are demanding Bangladeshi politics to be wiped clean of politicians associated with corruption and mismanagement, not just during Hasina’s rule but also in the governments that came before her. The trouble is that Hasina’s political DNA is found in every corner of the Bangladeshi state she left behind. Her hand-picked judges, bureaucrats, police and military commanders are still running the show. Making the new government acceptable to the people will require a messy process of administrative reshuffle, terminations and outright arrests of Hasina’s personnel, a process that has already begun. During his first televised speech, General Zaman promised to bring justice to the victims of indiscriminate killings by the state apparatus during Hasina’s reign. Newly appointed advisers of the interim government echoed this intention. That accountability process, however, will certainly be lengthy and it is not clear if it can ever be completed under their watch. Reforming the police, civil bureaucracy and military command to restore people’s confidence in any future electoral process will also take time. Dr Yunus also has to address various challenges in relations with Bangladesh’s two big neighbours: India and China. India, the country that was the chief defender of Hasina on the world stage, is both shocked and saddened by her departure. It has security concerns about the possible breakdown of law and order, and targeted repression of the large Bangladeshi Hindu population. Gobinda Chandra Pramanik, one of Bangladesh’s most prominent Hindu community leaders, has sought to assuage Indian fears, stating that Hindus are facing just as much anarchy as the rest of the country at the moment and things are gradually calming down as volunteers from major political parties are showing up to protect the Hindu community. The cabinet of advisers and major political parties in general may need to address Indian pressure so that personnel who posed serious national security threats to that country do not return to power. That negotiation will be complicated. Hasina’s geopolitical chessboard was to counter American concerns on human rights by addressing India’s security fears and engaging with China’s business interests. Now, the future government may be busy blunting Indian security concerns by delivering on the Americans’ anxieties about China. Orchestrating this geopolitical dance will benefit from the broad international acceptance that Dr Yunus brings, but execution and delivery may still be difficult. The main task for the interim government remains organising a new general election. Demands for a tribunal to prosecute thousands of illegal deaths and gross human rights violations either locally or internationally may make things complicated for the Awami League’s participation in a future national election. The party itself may also predicate its future electoral participation on conditions favouring a return of Hasina’s clan, if not Hasina herself. All other parties will also have to navigate legal difficulties, given the serious criminal charges filed under Hasina against her political opponents to make them ineligible for contesting elections. That includes Tarique Rahman, the de facto leader of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party, who is serving a life sentence over his alleged role in a 2004 plot to assassinate Hasina. Bangladesh’s largest Islamic political party, Jamaat-e-Islami, was banned on August 3 and had been barred from running in elections since 2013. Given the immense hurdles, it is likely the current interim government in Bangladesh will last several months, if not at least a year. Upon swearing in, the advisers gave no indication regarding the duration of their tenure. Many Bangladeshis are calling the overthrow of Hasina their second independence – the first one being breaking away from Pakistan 53 years ago. There is exuberance and hope for a better future everywhere. But optimism should be cautious. Whether this latest revolution enshrines a fairer, freer, less brutal and democratic Bangladesh depends on the practicality of the demands placed by the revolutionaries and the dexterity of the new administration, regarding not only managing them but also addressing pressures from external forces.

https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/8/10/bangladesh-chief-justice-agrees-to-resign-amid-new-student-protests,8/10/2024,"The chief justice of Bangladesh’s top court has said he agreed “in principle” to resign after an ultimatum from protesters, days after Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina fled to neighbouring India. Obaidul Hassan, who was appointed to helm the Supreme Court last year and is seen as a loyalist to Hasina, was told to step down on Saturday by protesters who gathered outside the court in the capital, Dhaka.     Al Jazeera’s Tanvir Chowdhury, reporting from Dhaka, said students decided to take to the streets when they heard reports that Hassan was holding a meeting with justices of the Appellate Division. “They viewed this as a judicial coup in the making, so they quickly gathered at the Supreme Court and demanded that he immediately resign,” Chowdhury said. A formal letter confirming Hassan’s decision to step down was expected after consultations with President Mohammed Shahabuddin. The students believe the Supreme Court to be highly politicised and want the other seven members to also resign, according to Chowdhury. Awami League party leader Hasina, 76, fled by helicopter to India on Monday. Her government was accused of widespread human rights abuses including the extrajudicial killing of thousands of her political opponents. Hassan oversaw a much-criticised war crimes tribunal that ordered the execution of Hasina’s opponents, and his brother was her longtime secretary. Cabinet ministers left blindsided by her sudden fall have gone to ground, while several top appointees have been forced out of office, including the national police chief and the central bank governor. On Friday, the bank’s governor, Abdur Rouf Talukder, resigned from the post, citing personal reasons. Protesters had stormed the central bank’s headquarters amid the political upheaval that led to the end of Hasina’s 15-year rule. Muhammad Yunus, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2006 for his pioneering work in microfinance credited with helping millions of Bangladeshis out of poverty, is leading a transitional government, another demand by the student leaders. The economist took office on Thursday as “chief adviser” to a caretaker administration comprised of civilians bar one retired brigadier-general. He said he wants to hold elections “within a few months”. Yunus appealed for religious unity on Saturday as he embraced the weeping mother of the first student shot dead by police during antigovernment protests last month. “Don’t differentiate by religion,” he told reporters. “Our responsibility is to build a new Bangladesh.” Speaking of Abu Sayeed, Yunus said the slain 25-year-old was now “in every home”. “The way he stood, we have to do the same,” he said as he paid his respects alongside members of the advisory cabinet. “There are no differences in Abu Sayeed’s Bangladesh,” he added.

https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/8/9/will-yunus-led-interim-government-bring-bangladesh-out-of-its-dark-era,8/9/2024,"Dhaka, Bangladesh – Maliha Namlah says she had been holding her breath since Monday when student-led protests in Bangladesh forced longtime Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina to resign and flee the country after weeks of deadly unrest in which more than 300 people were killed. Namlah, 19, was one of the coordinators of the student movement at Jahangirnagar University on the outskirts of the capital, Dhaka. As soon as Hasina’s government fell, her only worry was whether it would be replaced with another military rule in a country that has seen several coups since its independence from Pakistan in 1971.     But the current army chief, General Waker-uz-Zaman, has been hailed for taking charge of a country in turmoil and announcing the formation of an interim government as soon as Hasina fled. “We didn’t fight and shed blood for a military government. We wanted a civilian government that will bring genuine reforms,” Namlah told Al Jazeera on Friday. “And we are relieved to see that that happened quickly.” Three days after Hasina quit, Muhammad Yunus, the South Asian country’s only Nobel laureate, was sworn in on Thursday night as the “chief adviser” of a caretaker government tasked to bring peace and democracy, both of which Hasina’s critics said were undermined during her 15 years of “autocratic” rule. The chief adviser of the caretaker government holds the rank of the prime minister while members of the advisory council are granted the status of ministers.    As the new administration takes over in Dhaka, many are wondering whether it will be able to take the country of 170 million people out of what one of the members of the new government called a “dark era”. “The army chief had promised an interim government, but until it was officially established, uncertainty remained due to widespread speculation,” Saifullah Sajib, an employee at a travel agency in Dhaka, told Al Jazeera as he watched a live telecast of Yunus and his 16-member cabinet take their oaths at the presidential palace. The protests in Bangladesh that began last month were led mainly by tens of thousands of university students opposed to a quota system for government jobs that they alleged favoured those close to Hasina’s Awami League party. The primarily peaceful demonstrators were attacked by both the security forces as well as supporters of Hasina’s party, resulting in nearly 300 deaths and transforming the protests into a larger call for Hasina to quit. Hours after she resigned and fled to neighbouring India in a military aircraft, the Students Against Discrimination, an umbrella group of student movements that led the protests, proposed 84-year-old Yunus as the head of an interim government. Yunus, an economist and banker, was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2006 for his efforts to bring millions of people out of poverty through microloans. He is also a longtime critic of Hasina and hailed the success of the student-led protests as a “second independence day” for Bangladesh. “I feel so relieved to see Dr Yunus sworn in as the head of the interim government,” Abdullah Al Mamun, a businessman in the garments industry, told Al Jazeera. “I hope that someone with his credentials will be able to guide the country through this crisis.” After his swearing-in on Thursday, Yunus told reporters as he was flanked by student leaders: “Bangladesh is a family. We have to unite it. It has immense possibility.” He said his government’s “foremost promise is to ensure that everyone can enjoy the fresh air of freedom”. “We must ensure that the benefits of this freedom extend to every citizen. Otherwise, it would be meaningless. Therefore, we commit to bringing freedom to every home,” he said, adding that those who committed wrongdoing during Hasina’s tenure “will be held accountable”. Analysts said one of Yunus’s main challenges will be to ensure law and order after days of chaos that saw attacks on the houses of Awami League politicians, sporadic attacks on temples and homes of minority Hindus who were considered close to the ousted Hasina, and a general absence of policing, manifested by students this week managing traffic on the busy streets of Dhaka.    Acknowledging the disorder, Asif Nazrul, professor of law at Dhaka University and member of Yunus’s interim government tasked with running the Ministry of Law and Justice, said it is grappling with multiple challenges due to the unprecedented situation in the country. “Under [Hasina’s] autocratic rule, it was a dark era, and the people’s profound anger against the regime led to this eruption. However, we can no longer support such outbursts as they have exceeded acceptable limits,” he said. The interim government is a mix of both experience and youth and includes rights activists, professors, lawyers, former government officials and other prominent members of Bangladesh’s civil society. But it is the surprise inclusion of two 26-year-old student leaders who spearheaded the recent movement against Hasina that is likely to be a talking point in the coming days. Nahid Islam, a student of sociology at Dhaka University, has been given the telecommunications portfolio while Asif Mahmud, a student of linguistics at the same university, will look after sports. “If Bangladesh is led by its youth, the country will stay true to its goals,” Islam said on Thursday. Mahmud said he was ready for the challenges ahead. “The state institutions were devastated under [Hasina’s] fascist regime. Our goal is to eradicate fascism by reforming these institutions,” he said. Former army officer M Sakhawat Hossain has been given the Ministry of Home Affairs. He used to be close to Hasina’s Awami League but supported the student protests against her government. The Ministry of Finance has been given to Saleh Uddin Ahmed, who governed the central bank during the 2001-2006 rule of the opposition Bangladeshi Nationalist Party (BNP). Former diplomat and columnist Touhid Hossain will look after foreign affairs. Other notable figures in the new government are climate change minister Syeda Rizwana Hasan, a winner of the Ramon Magsaysay Award – often referred to as Asia’s Nobel Prize – for her environmental work; rights activist Adilur Rahman Khan, who will handle industries; electoral reforms activist Sharmeen Murshid, charged with the Ministry of Social Welfare; and women’s rights activist and advocate for biodiversity-based ecological agriculture Farida Akhter, who will run the Ministry of Fisheries and Livestock. The other members of the cabinet are former Attorney General Hasan Ariff (local government affairs), Yunus’s longtime associate Nurjahan Begum (health) and Muslim leader and academic Khalid Hossain (religious matters). The portfolios of the remaining three members – psychiatrist Bidhan Ranjan Roy from the minority Hindu community, former diplomat Supradip Chakma from the Indigenous Chakma community, based in the Chittagong Hill Tracts, and independence fighter Faruk-e-Azam – have not been declared. Michael Kugelman, deputy director of the Asia Program and senior associate for South Asia at the Woodrow Wilson International Center in the United States, told Al Jazeera that “on paper”, the interim government with its “wide array of leaders from all walks of life looks remarkably diverse”. “But how everything fits together and whether a consensus is possible is unclear. This is where Yunus’s leadership will be essential,” he said. One of the biggest allegations against Hasina’s long rule was her abuse of the security apparatus, mainly the police and a paramilitary force, which she used against political adversaries and is also accused of using to manipulate elections to help her hang on to power. Most recently, the police were employed against the antigovernment protesters in clashes that killed dozens of people as police officers fired live ammunition on demonstrators, intensifying the people’s anger against them. Since Hasina’s fall, an absence of law enforcement officials on the streets have seen people set up nighttime patrols to protect their neighbourhoods and the property of vulnerable minorities, mainly Hindus. After taking his oath, Yunus told reporters those “instigating anarchy” will face the “full force of law enforcement” and made assurances that “both the triumphant students and the public will work together to ensure their failure”. Khan, who now runs the Ministry of Industries, said the most complex task before the new administration will be to “dismantle the remnants of Hasina’s autocratic rule”. “This will involve making new appointments across nearly all positions in various departments and divisions, including law enforcement, the judiciary and different ministries,” he said. He said the new government will investigate all instances of human rights violations that occurred during Hasina’s tenure. “Upholding human rights will be a primary focus of the interim government,” he said.    Ali Riaz, distinguished professor of politics and government at Illinois State University in the US, told Al Jazeera the interim government “possesses both strengths and weaknesses, as is typical with any group”, and said he hoped more people will be brought into the government as it begins its work and assesses its needs. He said having younger individuals, especially students, in the cabinet was a positive development. “They should be able to reflect the perspectives of the younger generation and may offer innovative approaches and challenge traditional methods of governance,” he said. Riaz identified three immediate challenges before the interim government. The first is to establish a clear direction for the future. People have differing expectations, and some may demand immediate elections while others may call for structural reforms, he said. The second challenge, he said, is the economy. He said the government should implement “measures that benefit the general public” and demonstrate that “this government is distinct from its predecessors”. And the third challenge, Riaz said, is to reassess Bangladesh’s relationships with regional and global powers. “Over the past 15 years, these relationships, especially with India, had been shaped in ways that may have been detrimental to the country’s national interests,” he said. Many in Bangladesh fear Hasina’s close ties with New Delhi may force the new administration to take an anti-India stance, which analysts said could be detrimental to improving the economy. Journalist and commentator Shayan S Khan told Al Jazeera the primary mandate of the interim government will “clearly be to conduct free and fair elections”. He said conducting polls should be a relatively straightforward task for a nonpartisan interim government with no vested interests. “However, the circumstances of the Awami League’s departure might require additional time for it to regroup and prepare for the election, which could pose a challenge for the interim government. Without the Awami League, the election could lack a certain level of credibility,” he added. Kugelman, on the other hand, anticipated a long haul for the interim government and even the emergence of a new party, “perhaps led by Yunus and the protest leaders”. The main opposition BNP wants immediate elections, which Kugelman said could be a spoiler in the coming days. “The key question is how the BNP, by virtue of its size and clout as the biggest beneficiary of Hasina’s ouster, adjusts to a new reality that won’t necessarily defer to the BNP’s power,” he said. BNP politician Amir Khashru Mahmud Chowdhury said that while the interim government faces the “tough task of building the country from the ruins of the Awami League’s massive corruption, systematic destruction of the judiciary and bureaucracy”, it should also think about elections. “I think the people would definitely prefer to exercise their democratic rights of voting, which in the Awami era was not possible,” Chowdhury told Al Jazeera. “So I would urge the government to give people the scope of exercising their democratic rights.”    But there is also a lack of clarity among experts over whether an interim government must hold elections within 90 days of taking charge. Supreme Court lawyer Shahdeen Malik told Al Jazeera an “extraordinary government” has been formed in Bangladesh under “extraordinary circumstances”. “It is called an interim government, or some even call it a caretaker government with Dr Yunus as its chief adviser, but the fact is there is no provision in our constitution for the formation of such a government after the 15th Amendment [to the constitution], which removed the provision for such a government,” he said. In June 2011, during her first of four consecutive terms, Hasina’s government introduced the 15th Amendment to prevent any “unelected government” from assuming power. The move followed a Supreme Court ruling that had declared a caretaker government formed by the military from 2006 to 2008 was illegal because it remained in office for more than two years without calling elections within the mandated 90 days. Malik said that since there is no longer a constitutional provision, the interim government under Yunus is not obliged to hold elections within 90 days. He added, however, that the functioning of the new government could be legalised by making another amendment to the constitution. “General Ziaur Rahman did that through the Fifth Amendment, and General Hussain Mohammad Ershad did that through the Seventh Amendment. So this government will likely do the same,” Malik concluded. Badiul Alam Majumder of Citizens for Good Governance, a civil society group campaigning for political reforms, told Al Jazeera the Awami League’s unilateral passage of the 15th Amendment in a “majoritarian fashion effectively weaponised” the constitution. He said the abolition of the caretaker government system led to three “failed” elections in the country, in 2014, 2018 and 2024, and called for another constitutional amendment to include provisions that ensure free and fair elections in a “deeply divided and fractured country”.",2024,8
https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/8/8/islamophobic-alarmist-how-some-india-outlets-covered-bangladesh-crisis,8/8/2024,"Dhaka, Bangladesh – Within hours of Sheikh Hasina’s removal from power after a student-led mass uprising, reports began to appear in some Indian media outlets that members of Hindu minorities in Bangladesh were being targeted by “Islamist forces”. Articles and videos containing misleading content emerged across Indian media and social media platforms.     A video on The Times Group-owned Mirror Now’s YouTube channel, titled Attack on Hindus in Bangladesh? Mass Murders, Killings by Mob, shows footage of violence and arson attacks on four houses, two of them have been identified to be owned by Muslims. The title of the video is clearly misleading as there was no mass murders reported in the incident. Local reports say one of the houses belonged to Bangladesh’s freedom icon Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. The video also makes unsubstantiated claims, like “24 burnt alive by mob” and “Minorities at the centre of attacks”. Al Jazeera has independently verified that only two Hindus have been killed since Hasina’s ouster on Monday – one police officer and one activist with Hasina’s Awami League party. Hindus constitute about 8 percent of Bangladesh’s 170 million people and have traditionally been strong supporters of the Awami League, which is generally viewed as secular compared with the opposition coalition, which includes an Islamist party. Many news reports of attacks on Hindus contain outlandish claims such as “more than one crore [10 million] refugees are likely to enter West Bengal soon”, which was made in a Times of India report that quoted Suvendu Adhikari, a senior leader of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s governing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). The ANI news agency, seen close to Modi’s government, quoted a student leader in India as saying the mass uprising was “orchestrated by the enemies of Bangladesh”. An even more bizarre Times of India article stated that Jamaat-e-Islami, Bangladesh’s biggest Islamist party, “brought down Sheikh Hasina government in Bangladesh”. Political analyst Zahed Ur Rahman said Indian media have reported through an “Islamophobic” lens. “The student movement that fomented the mass uprising involving people from all walks of life is unanimously understood as a popular movement here in Bangladesh. But Indian media somehow have been interpreting the whole scenario through their Islamophobic eye,” he told Al Jazeera. As Hasina fled the country on Monday, news articles in Indian media alleged that Bangladesh’s protests were influenced by the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), a Pakistani spy agency, because it is seeking to turn Bangladesh into an Islamic state with the support of political parties like the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) and its former political ally Jamaat-e-Islami. Some media outlets even urged the Indian government to prepare for a potential refugee crisis, speculating that Hindus would be driven out of Bangladesh. Speculation suggesting an ISI and Chinese connection to the popular Bangladesh movement was a common thread in social media posts by some commentators and media outlets. The diplomatic affairs editor of The Economic Times, Dipanjan R Chaudhury, posted on X: “Jamaat-e-Islami in Bangladesh politics doesn’t bode well either for country or India. Jamaat track record of promoting cross border terror … is part of recent history.” The television channel TV9 Gujarati with one million followers on X characterised the uprising as a “coup”, stating on the social media platform: “Is ISI behind the coup attack in Bangladesh? Is Jamaat-E-Islam behind the violent attacks?” These articles by Indian media and posts in social media contrast sharply with factual reports chronicling the events that led to the Hasina’s resignation. She fled to India, which had backed her. Local media in Bangladesh reported that since Monday night, several Hindu households across 20 of the country’s 64 districts have been attacked and looted. Al Jazeera reached out to sources in some of these districts and discovered that the attacks on Hindu households were not driven by religious identity but by political affiliations. Mustafizur Rahman Hiru, a rent-a-car driver from the central district of Narsingdi, told Al Jazeera that in his village, the two Hindu households targeted were home to local Awami League leaders. “People were angry because these Hindu leaders were bullying others when the Awami League was in power. Now, with Hasina’s fall, they are facing the backlash,” he said. In Jashore, a border district with India, a warehouse and home belonging to Babul Saha, a local government chairman who ran for office on the Awami League ticket, were attacked. Abdur Rab Haider, a resident of Jashore, told Al Jazeera that no Hindu household had been attacked without ties to the Awami League. Rahman pointed out that Sajeeb Wazed Joy, Hasina’s son, who resides in the United States, has given several interviews to Indian media, spreading rumours and unverified claims about attacks on Hindus and alleged operations by the ISI. “Indian media merrily jumped onto it and spread Joy’s bogus claims,” Rahman told Al Jazeera. In an interview with Al Jazeera, Gobindra Chandra Pramanik, a leader of the Hindu community in Bangladesh, stated that to his knowledge no Hindu households without connections to the Awami League were attacked. “As a leader of the Hindu community, I can confirm that these attacks were politically motivated, not communal,” he said. “Across the country, 10 times more Muslim households affiliated with the Awami League were attacked.” Local media reported that since Monday night, more than 119 people – primarily Awami League leaders, activists and police – were killed in mob violence. Qadaruddin Shishir, the fact-checking editor for the AFP news agency, told Al Jazeera that only two of the victims were Hindus: one policeman and one Awami League activist.    Zafar Sobhan, editor of Bangladesh’s Dhaka Tribune newspaper, told Al Jazeera that most of the Indian media “as a general rule is clueless about Bangladesh”. “I don’t like to attribute to malice that which just as easily can be explained by incompetence. But the uniformity of the misinformation that is routinely peddled in the Indian media suggests that they are taking dictation from a common source,” he said. But an Indian academic rejected any allegation that the Indian media’s reporting has been Islamophobic. Sreeradha Datta, a professor at OP Jindal University in Sonipat in northern India, told Al Jazeera that the Indian media’s concern about the safety of Hindus under a non-Hasina administration in Bangladesh stems from past experiences rather than Islamophobia. Datta noted that during previous non-Awami League governments, such as the BNP-Jamaat alliance, “there was an increase in attacks on minorities, and this historical context continues to influence current perceptions.” The media’s reporting has caused concern in India with several prominent Hindu religious leaders and politicians calling for the protection of Hindus. Meanwhile, images of individuals, including students from Muslim religious schools, standing watch in front of Hindu temples and homes have been widely circulated on social media. In Brahmanbaria, a district with one of the largest Hindu populations in Bangladesh, residents, including students, stepped up to protect Hindu households. Munshi Azizul Haque, an apparel businessman from Brahmanbaria, told Al Jazeera that they are working to prevent any communal violence in the area. “We’ve seen how Indian media are depicting attacks on minorities in Bangladesh on social media. The reality is quite different,” he said. Pramanik also acknowledged that Hindu temples were being protected. News of Bangladeshi students, including from religious schools, volunteering to protect Hindu temples have been reported locally since the unrest began, and it has been picked up by outlets like Clarion India and The Wire. These sites ran headlines stating “Muslims Stand Guard at Temples, Call to Protect Minorities” and “Students Stand Guard Outside Temples and Churches in Wake of Attacks.” Siddharth Varadarajan, founding editor of The Wire, told Al Jazeera that while there is legitimate and genuine concern about reports of attacks on Hindu places of worship, businesses and homes across more than two dozen districts in Bangladesh, the Indian media are also exaggerating the scale and extent of these incidents. Also, he said, there is a section of the Indian media that is using the Bangladesh situation to boost anti-Muslim rhetoric “in service of the BJP and [its ideological parent] RSS’s agenda. “For them, the ouster of Hasina is an Islamist conspiracy hatched in collaboration with Pakistan and China and that the target is India and Hindus,” he said. Naresh Fernandez, editor of the Indian news portal Scroll.in, said Hindutva (right-wing Hindu nationalism) supporters in India are using the situation in Bangladesh “as a screen on which to project their own anxieties, fantasies and conspiracy theories to serve their narrow political purposes”. “They are claiming that Hasina’s fall was actually engineered by international forces and that this is a rehearsal for a similar regime change to be effected in India,” Fernandez told Al Jazeera. He said, however, that Hindutva supporters are rightfully concerned about the safety of minorities in Bangladesh in this period of crisis, “a concern that they fail to demonstrate about minorities in India”. Political analyst Farid Erkizia Bakht, meanwhile, suggested that misinformation spread by Indian media reflects New Delhi’s intent to destabilise Dhaka. He noted that India has lost its most valuable ally in the subcontinent and is deeply concerned about the direction of the incoming administration. Varadarajan also echoed the sentiment. “The popular uprising which unseated Hasina caught New Delhi by surprise, and the government is now scrambling to formulate a coherent and rational policy in the face of the new situation. “It cannot welcome the student-led protest and bottom-up expression of people power or dismiss the change as a ‘coup’ or an ‘anti-India conspiracy’ either as the Hindutva right wing on social media is saying,” he said. “For now, New Delhi will be in a wait-and-watch mode. The focus will be on ensuring the safety of Indian nationals in Bangladesh and monitoring the situation of minorities there,” he added. Bangladeshi activist and author Aupam Debashis Roy told Al Jazeera that there had been attacks on Hindu minorities but the numbers have been overblown and Bangladesh is being portrayed as being taken over by “Islamist forces”, which is not true, he said. The nature of the soon-to-be-formed interim government will not be “radical Islamist” in nature, Roy said. “But the BJP-leaning media wants to spread the world that Bangladesh is going to be in the hands of Islamists because it supports their [the BJP’s] narrative … built around previous laws like CAA and NRC,” Roy said, referring to India’s citizenship law and national register of citizens, which have been criticised as being directed against Muslims. “They want to show that Bangladesh is a place for radical Islamists and Hindus and minorities are not safe here. I think that’s why the BJP-leaning Indian media is spreading misinformation about attacks on minorities and an Islamist force taking over Bangladesh,” he added. US-based Bangladeshi political commentator Shafquat Rabbee Anik said the violence occurring in Bangladesh is a result of the “collapse of the police force,” which is “mostly due to popular reprisal against excesses committed by them throughout the last 15 years”. Once Nobel Peace Prize-winning economist Muhammad Yunus officially becomes the leader of the interim government, that will calm down “Indian nerves”, Anik predicted. “For one, it will be very hard to portray Yunus as an Islamist trying to take away the rights of the minorities and women.”",2024,8
https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/8/8/muhammad-yunus-takes-oath-as-head-of-bangladeshs-interim-government,8/8/2024,"The Nobel Peace Prize-winning economist Muhammad Yunus has been sworn in as the head of Bangladesh’s interim government, three days after Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina was forced to resign and flee to neighbouring India. Yunus, 84, took the oath during a ceremony at the presidential palace in Dhaka on Thursday night that was attended by political leaders, civil society leaders, generals and diplomats. “I will uphold, support and protect the constitution,” Yunus said as he was administered the oath by President Mohammed Shahabuddin, adding that he will perform his duties “sincerely”. More than a dozen members of his cabinet, whose titles are advisers, not ministers, also took the oath as the caretaker government will now seek to restore peace and prepare for new elections.     They include Nahid Islam and Asif Mahmud, top leaders of the Students Against Discrimination group, which led the weeks-long protests that ousted Hasina. Others include Touhid Hossain, a former foreign secretary, and Hassan Ariff, a former attorney general. Syeda Rizwana Hasan, an award-winning environmental lawyer, and Asif Nazrul, a top law professor and writer, were also sworn in. Adilur Rahman Khan, a prominent human rights activist who was sentenced to two years in jail by Hasina’s government, also took the oath as an adviser. No representatives of Hasina’s Awami League party were present at the ceremony. Hasina quit on Monday after nationwide protests that began in July against a quota system for government jobs that critics said favoured people with connections to her party. But the demonstrations soon grew into a bigger challenge for Hasina’s 15-year rule as more than 300 people, including students, were killed during spiralling violence. Yunus, who was awarded the 2006 Nobel Peace Prize for his work developing microcredit markets, was in the French capital for the 2024 Olympics when he was chosen for the interim role and returned home earlier on Thursday to tight security at the airport in Dhaka. In his first comments after his arrival, he said at a news briefing that his priority would be to restore order. “Bangladesh is a family. We have to unite it,” Yunus said while flanked by student leaders. “It has immense possibility.”    Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi offered his “best wishes” to Yunus, saying New Delhi was “committed” to working with neighbouring Dhaka. “My best wishes to Professor Muhammad Yunus on the assumption of his new responsibilities,” Modi wrote on the social media platform X. “India remains committed to working with Bangladesh to fulfil the shared aspirations of both our peoples for peace, security and development.” The United States also welcomed the new interim government in Bangladesh, saying it hoped to work together to advance democracy. “We welcome Dr Yunus’s call for an end to the recent violence and we stand ready to work with the interim government and Dr Yunus as it charts a democratic future for the people of Bangladesh,” State Department spokesman Matthew Miller told reporters. He said that the highest-ranking US diplomat in Bangladesh, Helen LaFave, attended the inauguration ceremony and has been in touch with the interim government. The US had a largely cooperative relationship with Hasina over her 15 years in power that had grown tense as she bristled over US criticism on her record on democracy.    Al Jazeera’s Tanvir Chowdury, reporting from Dhaka, said Yunus wants the people to feel secure and has asked people not to seek vengeance or reprisal. “Most people say it would be good if the interim government stays for a long time to clean up the system,” he said. Chowdury said the people want an independent judiciary and election commission to “depoliticise the system”. “Because whenever there is a political government, there are a lot of people who are loyal to that government and given a higher position, and that whole system gets corrupted,” he said. On Wednesday, a tribunal in Dhaka acquitted Yunus in a labour law violation case involving a telecommunications company he founded in which he was convicted and sentenced to six months in jail. He was out on bail in the case. Yunus has been a longtime opponent of Hasina, who had called him a “bloodsucker” allegedly for using force to extract loan repayments from rural poor people, mainly women. Yunus has denied the allegations.",2024,8
https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2024/8/8/bangladesh-economy-under-pressure-amid-uncharted-political-turmoil,8/8/2024,"The student protests that have rocked Bangladesh since July 1 and led Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina to flee in the middle of the night in a helicopter to New Delhi have battered the domestic economy, with losses estimated at billions of dollars. Now, even as Nobel Laureate Muhammad Yunus prepares to guide an interim government in Dhaka, businesses are struggling with the unprecedented nature of recent events and what comes next.  “Very few expected the situation to turn the way it had,” Vina Nadjibulla, vice president of research and strategy at the Asia Pacific Foundation of Canada, told Al Jazeera, referring to the dozens killed and injured earlier this week and Hasina’s departure.     “Bangladesh has had many coups, but this is new – this people power, the sheer power of the demonstrators. Now we’re in uncharted territory.” This level of political turmoil will have economic ramifications, Nadjibulla said. Even before the events of last weekend and the bloodshed, Zaved Akhtar, president of the Foreign Investors Chamber of Commerce and Industry (FICCI), was reported saying that the Bangladeshi economy had suffered losses of $10bn due to the student protests and the curfews and communication blackouts. On Wednesday, the Reuters news agency reported that some garment factories, a key employer and revenue generator for the South Asian nation, had reopened after four days of closure. At the same time, there are concerns of damage to trade as at least one Indian clothing producer in Bangladesh said it was diverting its production to India for the rest of the year, Reuters said. “Those that were looking at Bangladesh as an attractive China+1 strategy … this political instability puts a question mark around it and makes it more urgent to restore law and order so that supply chains don’t get further impacted,” said Nadjibulla, referring to efforts by global businesses to diversify supply chains from China in the wake of ongoing tensions between Beijing and Washington, DC. While the immediate goal of the interim government should be to restore law and order, it will eventually have to come up with a plan to address the stresses in the economy that were driving the protests, said Michael Kugelman, director of the South Asia Institute at the Wilson Center. About 67 percent of Bangladesh’s 170 million people are aged 15-64, and more than a quarter are aged between 15 and 29, according to the International Labour Organization. The country has made impressive advances on the back of economic growth of an average of 6.25 percent annually over the last two decades. But there is still significant inequality and poverty in the country with about 40 percent of Bangladeshis aged 15-24 not working, studying or training last year. “If those in charge are serious about addressing the economic stress, they’ve got to restore law and order as soon as possible. The last few weeks have been a nightmare scenario in terms of optics and will drive investors away … You have to make current investors safe so they don’t pull out,” Kugelman told Al Jazeera. Bangladesh is a key economic player not only as a garment manufacturer for many Western countries but also as an energy importer and one that has big infrastructure investments from countries including China and Japan. In 2023, for instance, it imported goods – mostly commodities like refined petroleum, cotton, fabric and fertilisers – worth $73bn, according to the CIA World Factbook. “I hope the new government has people who make the connection between restoring peace and stabilising the economy,” said Kugelman. “Uncertainty is something that can make commercial partners and investors even more uncomfortable. One thing Bangladesh’s economic partners don’t want is more unrest. But at the end of the day, all that these economic partners can do is watch and wait nervously,” he pointed out. India is one of the countries that is most likely to be affected by Bangladesh’s current unrest not only because of its historical relationship – it helped what was then East Pakistan gain freedom from West Pakistan – but also because Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been a staunch ally of Hasina. “There could be heightened risks to Indian companies, but it comes back to the law and order situation and if the new government can reign that in,” said Kugelman.",2024,8
https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2024/8/7/big-challenges-ahead-for-muhammad-yunus-bangladeshs-new-interim-leader,8/7/2024,"Bangladesh’s Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus has been asked to head the interim government in the wake of the political crisis that saw Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina flee the country on Monday. Yunus, 84, who hailed the weeks-long student-led protests that brought down the Hasina government as a “Second Victory Day”, has been a critic of Hasina’s 15 years of iron-fisted rule.     The protests began against a job quota, which reserved more than half the posts to particular groups including one-third for the descendants of 1971 war veterans. It was scaled back by the Supreme Court on July 21, but it did not assuage the protesters. “This is our beautiful country with lots of exciting possibilities. We must protect and make it a wonderful country for us and for our future generations,” Yunus told reporters. The economist and entrepreneur takes over the reins of the country after one the deadliest protests in its history, which saw more than 300 killed and thousands arrested. Big challenges lie ahead as he has to establish law and order, revive the economy, and pave the way for free and fair elections. Ahmed Ahsan, a former World Bank economist and a director of the Policy Research Institute in Bangladesh, says Yunus “is the man of the hour, chosen by the students who spearheaded the entire movement”. “He commands enormous respect both in the country and in the world,” Ahsan told Al Jazeera.    Yunus, the third of nine children, was born in 1940 in a village near the southern port city of Chittagong in what was then East Pakistan. He graduated from the University of Dhaka in 1961. He joined Vanderbilt University in the United States in 1965 on a Fulbright scholarship for his PhD in economics, which he completed in 1969. He went on to become an assistant professor at Middle Tennessee State University in Murfreesboro, Tennessee in the US. During the 1971 liberation war against the Pakistani military, Yunus supported efforts to create an independent Bangladesh. He founded a citizens’ committee in the US city of Nashville and helped run the Bangladesh Information Center in Washington, DC, which lobbied the US Congress to stop military aid to Pakistan. In 1972, Yunus returned to an independent Bangladesh, and after a brief spell in the country’s new Planning Commission, joined the economics department of the University of Chittagong. In 1976, he visited nearby villages in Chittagong that were affected by famines a few years earlier as part of his field work at the university. Yunus lent 42 people in the village $27 and found that each of them paid the money back as scheduled. He found out that small loans or microcredits given to poor villagers made a huge difference. Traditional banks would not lend them money, forcing them to rely on unscrupulous money lenders who charged exorbitant interest rates. This was the beginning of Grameen Bank (village bank) which pioneered the provision of microcredit to poor people to allow them to start up new businesses. Yunus became known as the “banker to the poor” as he helped lift millions out of poverty through his Grameen Bank.  In 2006, Yunus and Grameen Bank were together awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for their work to “create economic and social development from below”. By that time, the bank had lent more than $7bn to over seven million borrowers, 97 percent of them women, with a repayment rate of nearly 100 percent. “I see poor people are getting out of poverty every day … we can see that we can create a poverty-free world… where the only place we’ll see poverty will be in the museums, poverty museums,” Yunus said at the time. Yunus is now faced with the rough and tumble of politics beyond the reams of theory. His immediate task will be to restore stability after five weeks of deadly protests, but the larger issue is the economic crisis that has seen the ballooning of food prices and a stagnant private job sector. “The new government will need to stabilise the economy and contain inflation … and stabilise exchange rates,” Ahsan from the Policy Research Institute told Al Jazeera. Jon Danilowicz, a former US diplomat who spent eight years working in Bangladesh, believes that Yunus’s appointment is a good choice as his international profile will help the South Asian nation of 170 million. “His great strength is his credibility and his profile internationally, particularly in the United States. He can tap into the reservoir of goodwill that exists there and the willingness of the United States to do what it can do to help Bangladesh,” Danilowicz told Al Jazeera.    The former diplomat, who is a board member of a rights NGO which works on Bangladesh, thinks there are three big challenges for the interim government: dealing with the economic issues; unravelling the politicisation of the country’s institutions including the civil service, police and judiciary; and how to deal with the issues of accountability for serious human rights violations. “He must establish civilian control and supremacy early on and make sure that the army goes back to its normal role of supporting the civilian administration,” Danilowicz said. On the diplomatic front, Yunus will have to strike cordial ties with India, which backed the Hasina administration despite her rights violations and repression of opposition voices. Hasina is currently in India. “The new government must have cooperative relations with India as a hostile Indian government could be a spoiler, causing problems for Bangladesh,” Danilowicz said. Yunus became the target of Hasina’s ire after he floated the idea of launching a political party in 2007. Yunus’s initial idea of launching the party came against the backdrop of the failure of the two main parties – Hasina’s Awami League and the opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) – to address rampant corruption and rising income inequality. In 2011, Hasina, who perceived the then-71-year-old respected economist as a political threat, removed Yunus from his position as managing director of Grameen Bank, calling him a “bloodsucker” of the poor. Her government subsequently launched financial investigations into his non-profit businesses. Last year, he was convicted for violating labour laws, and he has been subject to an ongoing corruption case that many consider bogus. The latest protests, which began against government job quotas but morphed into a much larger peoples’ movement, were a sign that the country’s youth, who comprise one-third of the population, sought a new kind of politics with greater democracy and accountability. Yunus “has been under constant persecution by the previous regime and he could have chosen to leave the country but he never considered that possibility”, Ahsan said. “He has been willing to stand by his own institution and his country, so clearly he is a patriot.”",2024,8
https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/8/7/nobel-winner-yunus-heads-home-as-bangladesh-prepares-for-interim-government,8/7/2024,"Muhammad Yunus, the Nobel Peace laureate tapped to lead an interim government in Bangladesh, has called for calm as he boarded a flight to return home, a day before his new government is expected to be sworn in to replace deposed Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. Yunus, 84, was picked by President Mohammed Shahabuddin to lead the new interim government, a key demand of student demonstrators whose uprising drove Hasina, 76, to flee to India on Monday.     “I am looking forward to going back home, see what’s happening and how we can organise ourselves to get out of the trouble we are in,” he told reporters before boarding a flight at Paris’s Charles de Gaulle airport for Dubai where he was to connect to Dhaka.    “I fervently appeal to everybody to stay calm. Please refrain from all kinds of violence,” said Yunus, an economist and banker who was awarded the 2006 Nobel Peace Prize for founding a bank that pioneered fighting poverty with small loans to the general populace. He has been hailed for bringing thousands out of poverty through Grameen Bank, which he founded in 1983, and which makes small loans to businesspeople who would not qualify for regular bank loans. Bangladesh’s military chief said on Wednesday the interim government headed by Yunus would be sworn in on Thursday night after he returns from Paris to take over the administration and try to restore stability. General Waker-Uz-Zaman said in a televised address on Wednesday afternoon that those responsible for the violence since Hasina’s resignation would be brought to justice. The military chief, flanked by the chiefs of navy and air force, said he spoke to Yunus and would receive him at the airport on Thursday. Zaman said he was hopeful that Yunus would take the situation to a “beautiful democratic” process.    Hasina, who had been in power since 2009, resigned on Monday as hundreds of thousands of people, most of them students, flooded the streets of Dhaka demanding she stand down. The protests that began over a controversial quota in government jobs soon transformed into a call for an end to Hasina’s 15-year rule, which many in the country called “autocratic”. More than 400 people were killed during weeks of clashes between the protesters and the security forces as well as members of Hasina’s Awami League party. President Shahabuddin on Wednesday also announced the appointment of a new police chief, Mohammad Mainul Islam, to replace Chowdhury Abdullah Al Mamun as part of a shake-up of the security top brass that also included a new head of the technical intelligence monitoring agency and changes among senior army officials. After his appointment, Islam offered an apology for the conduct of officers during deadly protests and vowed an “impartial” probe into the killings. “We are committed to conduct a fair and impartial investigation into every recent killing of students, common people and the police,” he told reporters. “In the current protests… our previous responsible officials were not able to fulfil their duties as per the expectations of the countrymen,” he added. “I, as the chief of police, apologise on behalf of the Bangladesh Police for that.” He also said he had asked police units to end their strike and return to duty on Thursday, when Yunus is set to return to the country to lead the caretaker government.    Also on Wednesday, the main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), buoyed by its chief and former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia’s release from house arrest on Tuesday, drew hundreds of people to a rally in Dhaka and demanded elections within three months. In her first public speech since 2018, when she was convicted of corruption charges and jailed, Zia urged all not to follow the path of destruction in Bangladesh as she addressed her supporters from a hospital bed at a rally in Dhaka. “No destruction, no anger, and no revenge, we need love and peace to rebuild our country,” Zia, 78, said using a videolink. “I have been released now. I want to thank the brave people who were in a do-or-die struggle to make possible the impossible,” she said. “This victory brings us a new possibility to come back from the debris of plunder, corruption and ill-politics. We need to reform this country as a prosperous one.” Meanwhile, before the arrival of Yunus, a court in Bangladesh overturned his conviction in a labour case in which he was handed a six-month jail sentence in January. Yunus had called his prosecution political, part of a campaign by Hasina to quash dissent. “Let us make the best use of our new victory,” he said in a statement before departing Paris, where he had been receiving medical treatment while out on bail.",2024,8
https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2024/8/7/sheikh-hasinas-downfall-and-exile-are-of-her-own-making,8/7/2024,"After weeks of antigovernment protests, on August 5, Bangladesh’s Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina stepped down and fled the country in a spectacular turn of events. Until the last moments of her rule, her grip on power seemed all but absolute even after the deaths of hundreds of students who hit the streets demanding first reform of civil service job allocations and then her resignation. Hasina’s stubborn refusal to compromise, overreliance on state violence, and deep patronage ties to a privileged clientele class had long disconnected her from the Bangladeshi public. She perhaps did not see the extent to which she had lost the support of the majority until the very end, leaving her with no choice but to flee the country. The collapse of her 16-year rule renders both a cautionary tale to dictators worldwide and a proof of the sheer willpower of a nation’s disillusioned youth.     The irony is that Hasina herself rode the wave of young people’s support when she led the Awami League party in contesting the 2008 elections, which it won with a landslide. During her first term, she capitalised on youth sentiments in order to go after political leaders accused of committing war crimes during Bangladesh’s war of independence in 1971. She started executing opposition leaders while sparing the guilty of the same sin in her party. In 2013, she ordered a brutal crackdown on a sit-in by religious school students whom she had labelled radical Islamists, resulting in dozens of deaths. In hindsight, that should have been a warning sign to the Bangladeshi public. But they chose to keep faith in Hasina, who promised shiny new infrastructure and more employment. She did not spare any opportunity to trumpet her family tragedy and attacks on her life. Her family, including her father, Mujibur Rahman, the founder of the nation, was slain in a military coup in 1975. That she had no one but the people of Bangladesh to serve became her rallying cry; and it was too raw, too powerful to defy. Drawing on the wellspring of family lores and legacy, she relentlessly assailed her detractors, often calling them spawns of “razakars”, a derogatory term used to describe the abettors of the Pakistani military during the war of independence. Last month, she resorted to her time-tested rhetoric again, which provoked outrage among the protesters and demands for an apology from her. She, of course, found it too beneath her to apologise for or even acknowledge the harm her words had caused. Hasina’s refusal to listen to what people wanted stemmed from her long-held belief in her own political invincibility. As the scion of Bangladesh’s founding father, she had cultivated an image of herself as an unassailable, almost deity-like figure – the undisputed daughter of democracy. Compromising, in her mind, would have been an unthinkable sign of weakness that could have undermined the cult of personality she had built around herself over her 15 years in power. Even as her grip on the country slipped, Hasina remained convinced that her legacy and the loyalty of her core supporters would ultimately shield her from having to make such a humbling concession. Hasina’s fall from disgrace is of her making only. In pursuit of total power, she alienated her allies both at home and abroad. She went after those she held grudges against, from the ailing former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia to the nation’s only Nobel Laureate, Professor Muhammad Yunus, putting them under house arrest. Countless political activists, writers, and intellectuals were either imprisoned or disappeared during what can justifiably be called a “reign of terror”. Even sympathisers who attempted to offer her good-faith counsel were not spared from her wrath. Under Hasina’s leadership, Bangladesh was once seen as a model for those countries struggling to straddle competing powers in their neighbourhoods. But that balancing act imploded, too, as she fully entrenched into India’s orbit, unnerving China. Western countries also grew frustrated with Hasina’s flagrant violation of democratic and human rights principles. The United States started to show its displeasure with her government, sanctioning in 2023 government officials found responsible for impeding the democratic process or involved in corruption. But a defiant Hasina wore the American reprimand as a badge of honour and repeatedly mocked Washington for falling short on issues like public safety. Her bloody crackdown on the student protests from their start only deepened the diplomatic rift. Hasina assumed excessive force would do its work as it had done before. But she could not fathom the depth of discontent among the people over myriad issues, over the system of which she was the face. Student protests soon morphed into a mass movement, a Generation Z revolution. Hasina was inclined to apply even more force in a desperate attempt to cling to power, but her closest advisers warned against it, fearing the potential for even greater bloodshed. Her own son later revealed that she did not want to leave, but ultimately decided to do so on the insistence of her family, perhaps saving her from an even more humiliating end. Indeed, her authoritarian rule had alienated not just the public, but also key international allies and fleeing the country to India was her best option. Sheikh Hasina’s precipitous downfall in Bangladesh represents a pivotal moment, not just for the country, but for the broader global struggle between democracy and authoritarianism. The Bangladeshi youth have delivered a striking rebuke to those seeking to snuff the democratic aspirations of the people. Their victory serves as a powerful rejoinder to dictators who believe their grip on power is unassailable. As the world watches the unfolding events in Bangladesh, leaders across the globe must heed this cautionary tale. The lesson is clear: Underestimate the power of your citizens at your own peril. This triumph for democracy in Bangladesh offers a glimmer of hope at a time when the forces of autocracy appear to be on the march. The Bangladeshi youth have proven that even the most entrenched of dictators are vulnerable to the collective power of a mobilised citizenry. Their struggle has demonstrated that the human thirst for freedom and self-determination is a potent force, even against the most formidable political machines.

https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/8/6/the-day-after-in-dhaka,8/6/2024,"Dhaka, Bangladesh – A day after Sheikh Hasina’s 15-year autocratic rule ended, Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh, took on a sombre and unusual appearance. The city’s streets, which had been filled with jubilant crowds following Prime Minister Hasina’s fall around 2pm (08:00 GMT) on Monday, were now notably less busy, with fewer vehicles and pedestrians.     Most striking was the complete absence of police – no constables, officers or traffic sergeants were visible in the city of about 20 million residents. In many locations, traffic was being managed by people in their early 20s. At the Bijoy Sarani intersection, a major crossroads leading to the airport and parliament, about five or six young men were directing traffic with bamboo sticks, even a cricket bat. One man with a pointed goatee controlled the flow of cars heading towards the Tejgaon Industrial Area by waving a bamboo stick, first directing traffic towards the airport and then allowing vehicles bound for Tejgaon to proceed in an orderly manner. The scene where there once stood an iconic bronze statue of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the nation’s father and Hasina’s father, had also dramatically changed. On Monday night, a throng of people used ropes to topple the statue and dismantled its base using hammers and chisels. Enthusiastic crowds then moved in to collect pieces of the overturned statue. “It reminded me of the video of Saddam Hussein’s statue being pulled down,” said Asraf Ul Jubair when he shared a video of the scene on Facebook.    It was a similar scene at the Mohakhali intersection, another typically busy area of the city, where young people were directing traffic. One of them, Rabbi, who did not provide his surname or age, smiled when asked about his role. “There are no police… ‘shob bhagse’ – which means they [the police] have all vanished out of fear,” he explained. On Monday night, after the massive crowds celebrating Hasina’s fall had dispersed, a wave of violence erupted. Groups armed with sticks and sharp weapons moved through various parts of Dhaka, attacking individuals affiliated with Hasina’s Awami League party. Mahbubul Haque, a resident of Dhanmondi, an Awami League stronghold, told Al Jazeera that around midnight, a group of people arrived in a car and began vandalising the gate of an apartment building across from his home. The building was occupied by a prominent intellectual known for his strong support of Hasina’s controversial actions, such as the suppression of students during the quota protest. “At one point, they started firing guns, and we were terrified,” Haque recounted. “Then some armed forces arrived, and they fled in the car. It’s frightening.”    The violence continued throughout the night, with hundreds of videos of various attacks across the country circulating on social media and going viral. This led to widespread speculation, including claims that Hindu homes in Muslim-majority Bangladesh were being burned, and that police were firing bullets from police stations in different places as angry mobs tried to enter and burn those down. Jumanah Parisa, a third-year student at Brac University, told Al Jazeera that she stayed up all night reading and watching videos about events. She felt panicked. “We didn’t protest to make this land lawless,” she said. On Monday, clashes across the country resulted in at least 119 deaths – the deadliest day in the week-long protest. Because the police are seen as corrupted by the Hasina administration, many police stations were targeted by protesters. Moreover, Hasina’s close ties with the Indian government had led to rumours Indian agencies were helping her government suppress the protests. While some protest videos depicted atrocities like arson and violence, the speculation surrounding them was often exaggerated, according to Qadaruddin Shishir, a fact-checking editor for AFP, who spent Sunday night debunking claims and posting clarifications on social media. “The images of burning temples are outdated,” Shishir explained to Al Jazeera. “Yes, there were attacks on police stations due to grievances over police brutality, but the police involved were Bangladeshi, not Indian.” Meanwhile, images of people, including madrassa students, standing guard in front of temples and Hindu homes circulated widely on social media. Gobinda Chandra Pramanik, a leader of the Hindu community in Bangladesh, told Al Jazeera that Hindu temples were protected and no Hindus were killed. However, he noted that many Hindu homes and businesses were attacked by mobs in over 20 districts. “But those Hindus were associated with the Awami League party and they were not attacked because of their religious identity, rather because of their connection with Awami League,” said Pramanik. “I haven’t heard any news that a regular Hindu family without any political connection was attacked anywhere.” “Anyway, law enforcement must be immediately reinforced,” he said. “Otherwise, the situation will spiral out of control.” On Tuesday morning, the talk of the town was who would head the interim government. In most households and places, people were discussing that Muhammad Yunus, the country’s Nobel laureate, is going to head the government as its chief adviser. Most of the city meanwhile was calm, with no signs of violence or confrontation. However, in the upscale Dhanmondi area, crowds continued to gather at the remains of the Awami League chairperson’s office, the Bangabandhu Museum and Hasina’s former residence, Sudha Sadan. These sites had been set ablaze by an angry mob the previous afternoon. At noon, another building beside the Bangabandhu Museum, which was previously used for Awami League gatherings, was burning. “We will leave no trace of the Awami League in the country,” a young man, who declined to give his name, told Al Jazeera while he struck the building with a hammer. Road No. 3A, which housed several Awami League buildings including the party chairman’s office, resembled a war zone. At least three buildings were completely destroyed. Yusuf Banna, a resident of the road, told Al Jazeera he had been in a state of panic throughout the night. “People had such intense anger against the Awami League that it seemed unstoppable. I was worried about my family’s safety, as an angry mob is unpredictable.” In the nearby Kalabagan area, residents were seen using chisels and screwdrivers to deface a mural of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. Sabur Ali, a middle-aged man, proudly told Al Jazeera that he had been destroying symbols of the Awami League and Rahman since Monday noon. Saiyeed Abdullah, a law graduate and social media influencer, called for the immediate restoration of law and order. “We have successfully ousted a dictator and aspire to build a just nation. While I understand the grievances against the Awami League and Hasina, allowing angry mobs to control the streets is not sustainable,” he said. Abdus Shakur, a motor mechanic who spent Monday night awake in front of Dhaka’s Dhakeshwari temple, told Al Jazeera that citizen volunteers would ensure no vandalism, communal violence or crimes occur in the absence of police or law enforcement. “We are expecting a new government that will not only restore law and order but also provide proper justice,” said Shakur, 28. “Until then, we will remain vigilant on the streets.”",2024,8
https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/8/6/nobel-laureate-yunus-to-lead-bangladesh-interim-govt-presidents-office,8/6/2024,"Bangladesh’s Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus will head the country’s interim government after former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina stepped down and fled the country amid a mass uprising against her rule led mostly by students. The announcement early on Wednesday came from Joynal Abedin, the press secretary of President Mohammed Shahabuddin.     Abedin also said the other members of the Yunus-led government would be decided soon after discussion with political parties and other stakeholders. The leaders of the student protests, the chiefs of the country’s three divisions of the military, and civil society members, as well as some business leaders, held a meeting with the president for more than five hours late on Tuesday to decide on the head of the interim administration.    The students had earlier proposed Yunus and said the 83-year-old microfinance pioneer had agreed. He is expected to return to the country from Paris soon, local media reported. Following the decision, student leaders left the president’s official house shortly after midnight, satisfied and welcoming the decision. Nahid Islam, a leader of the student group, called the talks “fruitful” and said Shahabuddin had agreed that the interim government “will be formed within the shortest time” possible. Shahabuddin also sacked the national police chief in the wake of deadly protests that sparked Hasina’s departure and named a replacement, his office said. Yunus is a well-known critic and political opponent of Hasina. He called her resignation the country’s “second liberation day”. She had once called him a “bloodsucker”. An economist and banker by profession, Yunus was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2006 for pioneering the use of microcredit to help impoverished people, particularly women. The Nobel Peace Prize committee credited Yunus and his Grameen Bank “for their efforts to create economic and social development from below”.    Yunus founded Grameen Bank in 1983 to provide small loans to entrepreneurs who would not normally qualify to receive them. The bank’s success in lifting people out of poverty led to similar microfinancing efforts in other countries. He ran into trouble with Hasina in 2008, when her administration launched a series of investigations into him. He had announced he would form a political party in 2007 when the country was run by a military-backed government, but did not follow through. During the investigations, Hasina accused Yunus of using force and other means to recover loans from poor rural women as the head of Grameen Bank. Yunus denied the allegations. He was put on trial in 2013 on charges of receiving money without government permission, including his Nobel Prize and royalties from a book. He later faced more charges involving other companies he created, including Grameen Telecom, which is part of the country’s largest mobile phone company, Grameenphone, a subsidiary of Norwegian telecom giant Telenor. In 2023, some former Grameen Telecom workers filed a case against Yunus accusing him of siphoning off their job benefits. He denied the accusations. Earlier this year, a special judge’s court in Bangladesh indicted Yunus and 13 others on charges over the $2m embezzlement case. Yunus pleaded not guilty and is out on bail for now. Yunus’s supporters say he has been targeted because of his frosty relations with Hasina.",2024,8

https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/8/5/sheikh-hasina-a-critical-misstep-and-the-end-of-15-years-of-rule,8/5/2024,"Dhaka, Bangladesh – It all began with a single word: “Razakar“. In Bangladesh, “Razakar” is a highly offensive term. The word means volunteers but it refers to those who supported the Pakistani military’s operation to quell the 1971 Bangladesh liberation war and were accused of heinous crimes.     Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, 76, who resigned and fled the country in an army helicopter on Monday amid widespread unrest, has been known for using this term to label anyone she perceived as a threat or dissenter during her more than 15 years in power. The daughter of the country’s founding father and former President Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, Hasina was the leader of a pro-democracy uprising that toppled military ruler and then-President Hossain Mohammad Ershad from power in 1990. Hasina first became prime minister after her Awami League party won the elections in 1996. She came to power again in 2009, helping to achieve impressive economic growth, while growing increasingly autocratic, cracking down on free speech, dissent and opposition in Bangladesh, a country of 170 million and the world’s eighth-most populated. Hasina’s tenure as the longest-serving female head of government in Bangladesh was marked by the use of security forces, including the notorious Rapid Action Battalion paramilitary, which she was accused of using to abduct and even kill opposition members and dissenters, and allegedly rig the elections. Even the judiciary, a largely bipartisan institution, became compromised during her tenure according to critics, forcing a chief justice to flee the country after he opposed her in a ruling. Then there was the mainstream media, which, critics say, Hasina controlled to craft and maintain a narrative against her opponents. Most of Bangladesh’s mainstream media outlets are owned by businesses with ties to the Awami League. The control over the media allowed Hasina to depict her supporters as the legitimate heirs to the legacy of the country’s independence and its achievements, while portraying dissenters and opposition members from the Bangladesh Nationalist Party and Jamaat-e-Islami (Bangladesh Islamic Assembly) as remnants of treasonous and “extremist” factions. Former Prime Minister and key opposition leader Begum Khaleda Zia was imprisoned in 2018 on corruption charges, while a leading figure in Jamaat-e-Islami was executed in 2016. However, Hasina made a critical misstep by labelling students protesting for job quota reforms as “Razakar”, thereby crossing the rubicon.    During a news conference on July 14, Hasina was asked by a reporter about the student protests against job quotas which had been going on for more than a week. In response, Hasina dismissively remarked, “If the grandchildren of freedom fighters don’t receive [quota] benefits, who will? The grandchildren of Razakars?” Her comments ignited protests almost immediately. Students felt her remarks unfairly dismissed their efforts to address the “unfair” quota system in government jobs, which reserved some 30 percent of positions for the descendants of freedom fighters of the 1971 liberation movement. The students began protesting within hours, marching through Dhaka University’s campus, chanting a provocative slogan: “Who are you? I am Razakar.” Hasina’s response was heavy-handed, involving her party’s student wing, the Bangladesh Chhatra League (BCL), and the police to quell the protests. This led to a day of violence on July 16, which resulted in six deaths. Over the next four days, more than 200 people died, the vast majority students and everyday citizens, as police and BCL armed cadres fired live ammunition. Rather than condemning the violence, Hasina focused on the damage to government property, such as metro rail and state-owned television buildings. This only fuelled the anger of the students, who initially demanded a nine-point list of reforms, including Hasina’s unconditional apology and the removal of the minister for home affairs, Asaduzzaman Khan, as well as other ministers. The protesters’ demands eventually coalesced into one cry: Hasina’s resignation.    Born in 1947 in what used to be East Pakistan, Hasina was politically active from a young age. Her father, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, known as the “Father of the Nation”, led Bangladesh to independence from Pakistan in 1971 and became its first president. By that time, Hasina had already made a name for herself as a prominent student leader at Dhaka University. The assassination of her father and most of her family during a 1975 military coup left her and her younger sister as the only survivors, as they were abroad at the time. After spending a period in exile in India, Hasina returned to Bangladesh in 1981 and took over the leadership of the Awami League, the party founded by her father. She played a crucial role in organising pro-democracy protests against General Hussain Muhammad Ershad’s military government, rapidly gaining national prominence. Hasina first became the prime minister in 1996, earning recognition for securing a water-sharing agreement with India and a peace accord with tribal fighter groups in southeastern Bangladesh. However, her administration faced criticism for alleged corruption and perceived favouritism towards India, which led to her losing power to her former ally-turned-rival, Begum Khaleda Zia. In 2008, Hasina was re-elected as prime minister in a sweeping victory and subsequently led the government for the next 16 years. Throughout her extended tenure, Hasina’s administration has been characterised by widespread political arrests and severe abuses, such as forced disappearances and extrajudicial killings.    Rezaul Karim Rony, the editor of Joban magazine, told Al Jazeera, “She should have been tried for these crimes against humanity. Hasina has ruled through fear, implementing repressive laws and using her security forces to commit these atrocities.” According to Human Rights Watch, since Sheikh Hasina’s tenure began in 2009, security forces have been implicated in more than 600 enforced disappearances. Between January 2015 and December 2020, at least 755 people described as “militants” or “terrorists” by security forces were killed in 143 alleged shootouts and gunfights across the country, according to another HRW report. Rony added: “Hundreds of thousands of people were forced to leave their homes and live in hiding for years as Hasina used police forces to legally harass them and allow extortion.” Political analyst Zahed Ur Rahman told Al Jazeera that the most significant damage Hasina has inflicted on the country is corruption in key institutions such as the judiciary, election commission, media and law enforcement. He noted that recovering these institutions would be a lengthy process. Hasina previously said she was cracking down on corruption, but critics said there was no evidence that the government was ever serious about tackling the issue. Furthermore, Hasina has tarnished the legacy of Bangladesh’s liberation war by distorting its narrative. “The student protesters were so angered by Hasina labelling them as ‘Razakar’ that they began using the term themselves as a form of protest against her divisive tactics for political gain,” Rahman said. “Ultimately, this contributed to her downfall.”   ",2024,8
https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2024/8/5/the-victory-of-bangladeshs-student-movement-should-not-surprise-anyone,8/5/2024,"Twenty-five-year-old Abu Sayed, the son of a farmer and one of nine children, was a successful scholarship student at one of Bangladesh’s finest universities. He dreamed of one day securing a government job that would guarantee economic stability, and perhaps propel his family into upward mobility.  But when the government reinstated a quota system that awarded the descendants of “freedom fighters” – the people who liberated Bangladesh from Pakistan in 1971 – a shocking 30 percent of these highly coveted government jobs, his dreams were dashed. Sayed knew that there are 18 million unemployed young people in Bangladesh at the moment, and he did not want to be part of this damning statistic once he graduated. So he became a lead coordinator in a countrywide movement to reform the quota system, which came to be known as “Students Against Discrimination”.     At one protest, he stood some 15 metres (50 feet) away from the Bangladesh police and stretched his arms out in defiance. They shot him dead. The video of this blatant extrajudicial killing was shared like wildfire online, igniting a fire that brought hundreds and thousands of students across the country into the streets. Educators, lawyers, parents and rickshaw pullers joined them in solidarity, in anger and mourning over the death of Sayed and more than 200 other protesters who died at the hands of government-aligned student activists and armed forces. Their efforts, and the real risks they took, were not in vain. The High Court revised the quota system, assigning just seven percent of the jobs to the descendants of freedom fighters. But even this massive concession did not prove enough to end the unrest. The violence inflicted on it had drastically changed the student movement. The students now wanted to achieve much more than merely fixing the quota system. They wanted meaningful, systemic change. They wanted a new government, and they wanted Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina to resign. To the shock of much of the world, their demands were met earlier today. Recognising that she would not be able to break the resolve of the student movement – a movement that represents the very future of Bangladesh – Sheikh Hasina resigned from her post and hastily left the country in a military aircraft. A student movement, led by idealistic youths like Abu Sayed, managed to get an autocrat who ruled the country with an iron fist for 15 years to escape without looking back after five short weeks. The success of this movement is the strongest proof that Bangladeshi people are no longer content with economic progress at the cost of human rights, free speech and democracy. Indeed, in the past decade, Bangladesh under the leadership of Sheikh Hasina and her Awami League flourished economically. But as the economy went from success to success, the government assumed that this meant it could trample on the civil rights and freedoms of the population with impunity, ban opposition parties and rule as it wished, with no respect or consideration for the country’s laws and global democratic norms. Indeed, for 15 years, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina boasted at every chance she got about how she had slashed poverty in half in the least developing country, and used the country’s economic successes to divert attention from the large number of journalists and activists who were killed, jailed or disappeared for the sole crime of daring to criticise her government. But Hasina’s attempt to present human rights abuses, oppression, corruption and inequality as an inevitable price that needs to be paid for economic prosperity was an attempt that massively backfired. In the last decade or so, as a new generation came of age in what is repeatedly described as a “prosperous country that is on the rise”, something started to change in the psyche of the nation. Since Bangladesh secured its independence from Pakistan in 1971, youths in the country, traumatised by the violence inflicted on them and their elders by the Pakistani army, have largely been responding to the political imbalances and injustices that took hold in the newly founded republic in two ways: by trying to work within the system, or leaving. Indeed, a large number of Bangladeshis in my parents’ generation left the country in droves in the 80s and 90s for the United States, United Kingdom, Europe and even the Middle East in search of better futures. The ones who remained largely kept their heads low and refrained from resisting the government’s excesses. But in recent years, Gen Z Bangladeshis coming of age began to gravitate towards a third option. Unlike their parents, their dream and ambition was not to leave for the West, or stay and work the system. Their dream was to stay and reform the country. They were not willing to accept the human rights abuses of a corrupt government as the price they needed to pay for economic progress. Between 2018 and 2020, I interviewed dozens of young people while working as a foreign correspondent in Bangladesh.  Almost all of them were incredibly proud of the country’s rapid economic and technological progress, but were in despair over the declines in human rights and democracy. They loved their country, and they wanted to show their love by making things better, not staying silent. At first glance, it seems the students miraculously toppled Hasina’s all-powerful government in five short weeks, but this revolution was years in the making. Those who participated in the student protests this year – those who gave up their lives –  grew up watching the country prosper as the government became more and more authoritarian and abusive. Many had spent almost all their young lives looking for ways to decouple economic progress from democratic degradation. In 2018, after a bus lost control and killed two teenagers, the road safety movement was born. Students demanded safer streets by taking over the streets for five days, checking licenses and directing traffic which is notoriously difficult to navigate in Bangladesh. That same year, a student movement successfully led to the overturn of the quota system. In 2019, they took to the streets in droves after a student was killed by pro-government activists for his Facebook post criticising the government. Throughout all these movements, students saw for themselves how the government often blamed opposition parties for the violence perpetrated against protesters, even though government’s own student wing was often responsible for it. They also saw how their elders and those in power pointed to economic successes of the nation as a reason to be supportive of the current government’s actions and policies. Time and again, their revolutionary spirits were disheartened. Yet as they went from teenagers to young people in their mid 20s, they expanded their knowledge and maturity while managing to keep their passion alive. They wanted to free Bangladesh from its suffocating government and help it reach its true potential – as a democratic nation that respects and protects the rights of all its citizens. Today, after five weeks of bloodshed, pain, fear and heartache, they achieved their dream. Young Bangladeshis are now in charge of the country and perhaps for the first time in their lives, they have reason to be hopeful for the future. Sure, there will now be a caretaker government overseen by the Bangladeshi army. Some people are worried about this prospect, as in the past, such governments proved not ideal for protecting human rights and furthering democracy. But student leaders, who brought us to this moment, have already vowed that they will make sure this interim government will not be like any the country has seen before. They promised they will make sure this new government does not step out of line and does not take power away from the people. And I know they will hold to their word, because this is their country, their future, and their lifelong dream that they risked all they ever had to achieve. This revolution is a clear message from youths to those who have long held on to and abused power, not only in Bangladesh, but across the world. Your time is over.  Members of a new generation – not willing to give up on their rights, and ready to fight for justice at great personal cost – are now in charge. Change is now inevitable. We must all get on board, or get off the train. The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.",2024,8
https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/8/5/bangladesh-president-orders-release-of-ex-pm-khaleda-zia,8/5/2024,"Bangladesh’s President Mohammed Shahabuddin has ordered the release of jailed former prime minister and key opposition leader Khaleda Zia, hours after her archrival Sheikh Hasina was ousted and fled the country. The president’s press team said in a statement on Monday that a meeting led by Shahabuddin had “decided unanimously to free Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) chairperson Begum Khaleda Zia immediately”.     Army chief General Waker-Uz-Zaman, along with the head of the navy and air force, and top leaders of several opposition parties, including the BNP and the Jamaat-e-Islami party, attended the president’s meeting. Zia, 78 and twice the prime minister of Bangladesh, is in poor health and confined to hospital after she was sentenced to 17 years in prison for corruption in 2018. She shares a long-standing rivalry with Hasina, and was accused of misusing her power by embezzling some $250,000 in donations meant for an orphanage trust. The BNP has said the cases were fabricated and aimed at keeping Zia away from politics, allegations denied by Hasina’s government.    “The meeting has also decided to free all the people who have been arrested during the student protests,” the president’s statement added. More than 2,000 people had been arrested since last month during deadly street protests over a government job quota that soon transformed into a nationwide call for Hasina to quit office. Nearly 300 people were killed in weeks of protests that the authorities sought to crush. A night of deadly violence on Sunday killed close to 100 and a curfew to quash protests was called. Earlier on Monday, General Waker-Uz-Zaman said an interim government would be formed and the deaths in the course of the weeks-long protests would be investigated. “I promise you all we will bring justice to all the murders and injustice. We request you to have faith in the army of the country. I take full responsibility, and I assure you to not get disheartened,” the general said. The military also said it would lift the curfew at dawn on Tuesday and open offices, factories, schools, and colleges from 6am on Tuesday (00:00 GMT). Reporting from Dhaka, Al Jazeera’s Tanvir Chowdhury said that despite the violence, arrests and curfew, people on the streets were jubilant over Hasina’s exit. “Just a few minutes ago, an army patrol told protesters to go home, that the army was with them and that they should let the roads clear. They were saying the protesters were all protected and not to worry. But people are still planning to stay on the streets even though it’s not as crowded,” he said. Chowdhury added that what happens next in the country “depends on how the interim government is formed, who its members are and how acceptable they are to the public”.

General Waker-uz-Zaman, the chief of army staff, said in a statement on Monday that an interim government will take over with immediate effect and asked citizens to keep their trust in the army.     “I request you all to be a little patient, give us some time and together we will be able to solve all the problems,” Zaman said. “Please don’t go back to the path of violence, and please return to nonviolent and peaceful ways.” Hasina resigned after weeks of protests against quotas for government jobs flared into nationwide unrest. At least 280 people were killed and thousands injured as the government cracked down on the demonstrations. Hasina reportedly fled the country on Monday in a military helicopter to India, a strong ally of the former leader. Video reports by local news media, showed thousands of people storming the prime minister’s residence, chanting and singing in celebration as they ransacked it. Here’s the background that led up to the historic moment: What happened on Sunday? More than 90 people were killed on Sunday alone as clashes between security officials and demonstrators escalated and protesters called for Hasina to step down. Police fired rubber bullets and tear gas on a huge crowd of protesters in Shahbagh Square in the capital, Dhaka. Demonstrators in the northwestern district of Sirajganj also attacked a police station, killing at least 13 officers. Sunday saw the highest recorded single-day death toll since the protests broke out last month. Authorities imposed a “shoot-on-sight” curfew from 6pm (12:00 GMT) on Sunday and flooded the streets with police and military units to restore order. But thousands of people marched largely unrestrained early on Monday, defying the curfew, although there were reports of clashes outside the capital. However, as protesters started to hand flowers to the military about noon and as officers in turn embraced the demonstrators, it was clear that something had changed very quickly, Al Jazeera’s Tanvir Chowdhury said, reporting from Dhaka. “People are relieved that this brutal crackdown is finally over. It is game over for Hasina.” The demonstrations began in July in Dhaka and were initially led by students angry at a court’s reinstatement of a job quota scheme that was rescinded in 2018. The policy reserved 30 percent of government jobs for descendants of veterans who fought in the 1971 war of independence from Pakistan – most of whom are linked to Hasina’s Awami League party, which led the independence movement. A further 26 percent of jobs were allocated to women, disabled people and ethnic minorities, leaving open about 3,000 positions for which 400,000 graduates compete in the civil services exam. A fifth of Bangladesh’s 170 million people are unemployed. Rallies against the quotas intensified after Hasina referred to the protesters as “Razakars”, which refers to people who collaborated with Pakistan during the 1971 war. From July 10 to July 20, more than 180 people were killed in some of the worst periods of unrest during Hasina’s 15-year tenure. Police said protesters vandalised property and torched government buildings, including a national television station. The Supreme Court rescinded the job quota policy on July 21, ruling that 93 percent of jobs would instead be open to candidates on merit. But the protests continued unabated as students and other citizens assembled in a new wave of rallies. They called for justice for those killed and pressed a new, singular demand – that Hasina step down. Hasina and members of her cabinet sounded defiant until the end, accusing opposition forces of fuelling the protests. On Sunday, Hasina called the protesters “terrorists”. The world’s longest serving female head of government, Hasina, 76, is the daughter of Bangladesh’s founding father, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. She was first elected as prime minister in 1996 and again in 2009, serving a total of 20 years in office. Although Hasina won her fourth straight term in elections this year, she was accused of muzzling opposition forces and other forms of dissent, orchestrating disappearances and arranging extrajudicial killings. Hasina rejected the allegations. But as student protesters grew increasingly bold in July and chanted, “One, two, three, four, Sheikh Hasina is a dictator,” analysts speculated that Hasina would not be able to survive the biggest challenge to her rule. “A dictator has fallen,” political analyst Mubashar Hassan, who said he has lived in exile in Australia for years, told Al Jazeera on Monday as news of Hasina’s ouster broke and television visuals showed protesters in Dhaka climbing atop a large statue of Hasina’s father, chiselling away at the head with an axe. “This is an incredible moment. This is like a second independence of Bangladesh,” he said. “[Bangladesh has been] shackled by the tyranny of Sheikh Hasina and her regime. I couldn’t go back to Bangladesh since 2018, and hopefully, I’ll see my family soon.” Hassan said the government’s decision to deploy the army against the protesters appeared to be the tipping point that collapsed Hasina’s rule. The army is largely perceived in Bangladesh as a neutral entity and is well-trusted and respected by most people. In 2008 when an electoral crisis threw the country into a political stalemate, the military stepped in and ensured that elections were held in December that year. As the latest protests escalated, the army was cautious in its statements and appeared to be neutral. But on Friday, former military personnel expressed support for the protests, criticising the decision to remove border patrol units to quell the demonstrations. Former army chief Iqbal Karim Bhuiyan even turned his Facebook profile picture red in a show of support, hinting at the general mood in the military. Another tipping point, Professor Naomi Hossain of the United Kingdom’s School of African and Oriental Studies said, was the fear that there would be “an absolute bloodbath” on Monday as protesters again started to mobilise despite Sunday’s killings. “There was a very genuine and well-founded fear that today was going to be bloody,” she said on Monday. “… People were very fearful that today would be a bloodbath, so this really pushed the military into thinking about what they needed to do.” Details of how the interim government will be formed are still sketchy, but Zaman said he was holding talks with major political parties, including the opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party. It is not clear if the military itself will take power  as has been done in several military coups in the past. Student activists have said they would reject military rule. “We cannot afford that. … We are really hoping that the army is able to keep the peace as well as introduce some kind of interim system that can deliver us back to democracy,” Hossain said. Zaman also said the deaths in the course of the weeks-long protests would be investigated as calls for justice grew. “I promise you all, we will bring justice to all the murders and injustice. We request you to have faith in the army of the country. I take full responsibility, and I assure you to not get disheartened,” the general said. Meanwhile, Hasina arrived with her sister in Agartala, the capital of India’s northeastern state of Tripura, according to reports in Indian media.   ",2024,8
https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/8/5/timeline-sheikh-hasinas-reign-ends-after-15-years,8/5/2024,"Sheikh Hasina became Bangladesh prime minister for the first time after her Awami League party won the 1996 elections. Her second stint in power, which began in 2009, was marked by impressive economic growth. But she was accused of becoming a hardline leader and cracking down on dissent. Her 15-year rule is also known for human rights violations. The United States placed sanctions on the elite Rapid Action Battalion, linked to disappearances and extrajudicial killings. On Monday, following weeks of protests, the 76-year-old resigned and fled the country. Here’s a look at her time in office:  December 29, 2008 – The Awami League wins the general election, and Hasina becomes prime minister for a second time. February 2009 – The Bangladesh Rifles, a paramilitary force, revolts. More than 74 people are killed. Hasina’s government manages to restore order.    June 2011 – The 15th amendment to the constitution is passed. It brings significant changes, including removing neutral caretaker governments, which had governed during elections and government transitions. The opposition says keeping the caretaker system is essential for free and fair elections. February 2013 – Mass protests in Shahbagh, Dhaka, call for the death penalty for those who committed atrocities during the 1971 Bangladesh Liberation War. October 2013 – The Rana Plaza building collapses, killing more than 1,000 people and highlighting the lack of safety in the garment industry, which is the mainstay of Bangladesh’s economy. January 5, 2014 – The Awami League wins the general election, which was boycotted by the main opposition party and its allies. Hasina wins a second straight term as prime minister. January 2015 – Political unrest and violence erupt stemming from the opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party’s unmet demands after the 2014 elections. December 30, 2018 – The Awami League wins the general election amid vote-rigging allegations. Hasina secures a third consecutive term after winning 96 percent of the votes.    March 2020 – Bangladesh’s economy suffers due to the COVID-19 pandemic. A lockdown causes price rises, which lead to a cost of living crisis. December 2021 – The US imposes human rights-related sanctions on Bangladesh’s elite paramilitary force, the Rapid Action Battalion, and seven of its current and former officials, accusing them of involvement in hundreds of disappearances and extrajudicial killings since 2009. 2022 – Bangladesh reports gross domestic product growth of 7.2 percent, making it one of the fastest growing economies in the world. Garment exports and remittances drive the expansion. However, wealth disparities increase, and the wealthiest 10 percent of the population now controls 41 percent of the total income. January 2024 – Hasina wins a fourth straight term in elections boycotted by the opposition. July 2024 – Students launch protests against government job quotas, which reserve one-third of civil service posts for descendants of people who fought in the 1971 war for independence. The protests turn violent after a government crackdown and attacks by groups linked to the ruling party. July 29, 2004 – Protests resume and calls grow for Hasina’s resignation. August 4, 2004 – Nearly 100 people are killed during the protests, taking the total number of dead to almost 300. August 5, 2024 – Hasina resigns and flees the country. Protesters storm the prime minister’s residence.   ",2024,8
https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/8/5/bangladesh-protesters-make-defiant-call-for-march-on-dhaka,8/5/2024,"Defying a deadly crackdown and national curfew, protesters in Bangladesh have called for a mass march on the capital Dhaka. The student groups at the forefront of the protests urged a siege of the capital on Monday. The call rackets up the tension further following deadly violence on Sunday that saw close to 100 killed and the announcement of a national curfew.     Demonstrations that began last month over governmental job quotas have expanded into nationwide unrest amid a crackdown by authorities. Protesters are now demanding the resignation of long-term Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. “This student-citizen uprising will continue until the fall of Sheikh Hasina,” protest coordinator Asif Mahmud said in a message on Facebook late on Sunday. “Tomorrow is the ‘March to Dhaka’. Travel to Dhaka now to witness history. Join the ultimate fight,” he said. The violence has so far resulted in the deaths of nearly 300 people, and the tension was simmering in Dhaka on Monday, after authorities announced a nationwide curfew the previous evening. Army tanks and police vehicles were on the streets and security forces patrolled on foot, an online news channel showed. There was almost no civilian traffic, barring a few motorcycles and three-wheel taxis. Internet access was tightly restricted, offices were closed and more than 3,500 factories servicing Bangladesh’s economically vital garment industry were shut. On Monday afternoon, it was announced that Bangladesh’s army chief Waker-Uz-Zaman would address the nation at 2pm local time (08:00 GMT). At least 91 people were killed and hundreds injured on Sunday in a wave of violence across the country of 170 million people as police fired tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse tens of thousands of protesters. Protests began last month after student groups demanded the scrapping of a controversial quota system in government jobs. That has now escalated into a campaign to seek the removal of Hasina, who won a fourth straight term in January in an election boycotted by the opposition. Sunday’s death toll, which included at least 13 police officers, was the highest for a single day from any protests in Bangladesh’s recent history, surpassing the 67 deaths reported on July 19 when students took to the streets against the quotas. However, fears are rising that Monday could see further violence, with both sides appearing set on confrontation.  The government declared an indefinite nationwide curfew starting at 6pm (12:00 GMT) on Sunday and also announced a three-day general holiday starting from Monday. Hasina said those who were engaging in the “sabotage” and the destruction in the name of protests were no longer students, but criminals, and that “iron hands” should be used to deal with them. The Bangladesh army urged people to obey the curfew rules. “The Bangladesh army will perform its promised duty in line with the Bangladesh constitution and existing laws of the country,” it said in a statement late on Sunday. “In this regard the people are requested to abide by the curfew as well as give full cooperation to this end,” it said, adding that the curfew was imposed to ensure the security of people’s lives, properties and important state establishments.

https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/8/4/more-than-20-killed-as-bangladesh-protesters-renew-call-for-hasina-to-quit,8/4/2024,"At least 91 people have been killed, including 13 police officers, and dozens more injured in a new round of violence in Bangladesh as police fired tear gas and lobbed stun grenades to disperse tens of thousands of protesters who returned to the streets to ask Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina to resign. The deaths were reported by the police and doctors on Sunday in the capital Dhaka and the northern districts of Bogura, Pabna and Rangpur, as well as in Magura in the west, Comilla in the east, and Barisal and Feni in the south.     The attack on the police took place at the Enayetpur police station in the northwest city of Sirajganj, according to Additional Deputy Inspector General Vijay Basak of the Bangladesh police. The identity of the attackers is unknown. The demonstrators are demanding Hasina’s resignation after earlier protests in July that began with students calling for an end to a quota system for government jobs and escalated into violence that killed 200 people.    Hasina said those who were engaging in the “sabotage” and the destruction in the name of protests were no longer students, but criminals, and said the people should deal with them with iron hands. Authorities have blocked internet access and imposed a shoot-on-sight curfew. At least 11,000 people have been arrested in recent weeks. Deaths were reported from at least 11 districts including Bogura, Magura, Rangpur and Sirajganj districts, where the protesters backed by the main opposition party Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) clashed with police and the activists of the ruling Awami League party and its associated bodies. Al Jazeera’s Tanvir Chowdhury, reporting from Dhaka, described the situation as “volatile and dangerous”. “The protesters are saying that they are not going to move, until their government steps down,” he said. “People are extremely worried [about] what’s going to happen,” Chowdhury said, adding that the crowd of protesters is growing. He also reported clashes between the protesters and supporters of the Awami League. Prapti Taposhi, a student activist who witnessed clashes with police, told Al Jazeera the police were engaged in running battles with the demonstrators. “I am on the street right now, and I can see so many people here. This is not just a student protest or a ‘quota protest’,” she said. The government has now imposed an indefinite curfew that began at 6pm local time (1200 GMT), although protesters have continued to gather at the Shaheed Minar monument in central Dhaka. Protesters called for “noncooperation”, urging people not to pay taxes and utility bills and not show up for work on Sunday, a working day in Bangladesh. Offices, banks and factories opened, but commuters in Dhaka and other cities faced challenges getting to work. A ‘March to Dhaka’ protest has also been moved from Tuesday to Monday, a coordinator for the Anti-Discrimination Student Movement (ASD) told Al Jazeera. “This means we are urging students and the public nationwide to start their journey to Dhaka tomorrow to lay siege to the city,” the coordinator, Asif Mahmud, said. The government, meanwhile, announced a holiday from Monday to Wednesday. Courts will remain closed for an indefinite period. Authorities also closed schools and universities across the country. Mobile internet service was off on Sunday, while Facebook and messaging apps including WhatsApp were inaccessible even on broadband internet. Junior Minister for Information and Broadcasting Mohammad Ali Arafat said mobile internet and messaging services were off to help prevent violence. Arafat added to Al Jazeera that the government was acting “in a defensive position, not an offensive one”. “These miscreants attacked our activists and leaders and unleashed violence,” Arafat said, adding that the government has “always opted for a peaceful solution” and “never wanted violence”. The deadly protests began last month as students demanded an end to a quota system that reserved 30 percent of government jobs for the families of veterans who fought in Bangladesh’s war of independence against Pakistan in 1971. As violence intensified, the country’s Supreme Court scaled back the quota system to 5 percent of jobs, with 3 percent for relatives of veterans. But protests have continued demanding accountability for violence the demonstrators blame on the government’s use of excessive force. The unrest, which spurred the government to shut down internet services, is its biggest test since January when deadly protests erupted after Hasina’s Awami League won a fourth straight term in elections boycotted by the BNP. The protests have now grown into a wider antigovernment movement across the South Asian nation of some 170 million people. At least 11,000 people have been arrested in recent weeks. Critics of Hasina, along with several rights groups, have accused her government of using excessive force to stamp out the movement, a charge it denies. “We want the government to resign,” Jahirul Islam, a restaurant worker in Dhaka, told Al Jazeera. Dhaka-based political analyst Zahed Ur Rahman said that the government would be unlikely to resign “without bloodshed”. “For the past two days, peaceful gatherings and demonstrations have taken place across the country demanding the government’s resignation,” Rahman said, explaining that the protests were peaceful because of the absence of Awami League activists on the streets. However, once ruling party’s activists went to confront the protesters “they use gun[s] and violence to quell a popular uprising in front of the whole world”, Rahman said.

https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/8/3/students-renew-bangladesh-protests-call-for-nationwide-civil-disobedience,8/3/2024,"Protesters in Bangladesh have taken to the streets to demand justice for the more than 200 people killed in last month’s student-led demonstrations over quotas in government jobs. The large protests on Saturday came as student leaders called for a nationwide civil disobedience campaign until Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina’s government resigns.     Students Against Discrimination, the group responsible for organising the initial protests, rebuffed an offer of talks with Hasina earlier in the day. “She must resign and she must face trial,” Nahid Islam, the group’s leader, told a crowd of thousands at a monument to national heroes in the capital Dhaka to roars of approval. Reporting from Dhaka, Al Jazeera’s Tanvir Chowdhury said that the student movement had turned “into a public movement“, noting that people from all walks of life had joined Saturday’s protests calling for the government to resign. He added that clashes also took place between protesters and police in the Gazipur and Comilla districts in the capital’s outskirts.    Hasina on Saturday called upon protest leaders to meet her at her official residence Ganabhaban, saying the “door is open”. “I want to sit with the agitating students of the movement and listen to them. I want no conflict,” she said, according to local media. The prime minister has also appointed three senior officials to negotiate with the protesters, Chowdhury reported.    The demonstrations began over the reintroduction of a quota scheme – since scaled back by Bangladesh’s top court – that reserved more than half of all government jobs for certain groups. With some 18 million young Bangladeshis out of work, according to government figures, the move upset graduates facing an acute unemployment crisis. The protests had remained largely peaceful until attacks on demonstrators by police and pro-government student groups. Hasina’s government eventually imposed a nationwide curfew, deployed troops and shut down the nation’s mobile internet network for 11 days to restore order. Home Minister Asaduzzaman Khan told reporters that security forces had operated with restraint but were “forced to open fire” to defend government buildings. The government has been weathering a worsening backlash over the deadly police crackdown that resulted in deaths of at least 200 people including 32 children, as well as hundreds of pellet gun injuries. UN experts have called for an immediate end to the violent crackdown against protesters as well as accountability for human rights violations. UN Human Rights Chief Volker Turk today called on the government to disclose full details about its crackdown on protests and to provide the details of those killed, injured or detained for the benefit of their families. European Union foreign policy chief Josep Borrell also called for an international probe into the “excessive and lethal force against protesters”.",2024,8

https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2024/7/29/shot-in-the-eyes-victims-of-bangladesh-protest-violence-face-dark-future,7/29/2024,"Dhaka, Bangladesh — Within the sterile walls of the National Institute of Ophthalmology and Hospital (NIOH) in Bangladesh’s capital Dhaka, a sombre scene unfolds. Dozens of young men, their faces etched with worry and uncertainty, sit in silent anticipation. Some shield their injured eyes behind dark sunglasses. Others wear white bandages on one or both eyes.     One question hangs in the air: Will these men ever see the world clearly again? They are victims of pellet injuries — both survivors and reminders of the deadly clashes between protesters seeking job quota reforms and the security forces of Bangladesh that engulfed the nation of 170 million people for nearly two weeks this month. Among them is Mohammad Anik, a 24-year-old salesperson from Madaripur – a central district some 150km (93 miles) away from Dhaka. “There is a less than 50 percent chance that he [Anik] will get his eyesight back,” said a duty doctor at NIOH who requested anonymity. “There were several injuries in his two eyes and we had tried our best.” Last Monday, Anik was heading home from work when he got caught in a street clash between protesters and police. Before he could figure out what was happening, a pellet struck his face. He fell to the ground, unconscious and exposed, until bystanders intervened and took him to the hospital. Now, he finds himself amid the dozens of young men at NIOH, their futures shrouded in darkness. The NIOH has treated nearly 500 patients in the last few days, hailing from various districts including Dhaka, all grappling with severe eye injuries. Hospital records reveal that at least 278 of these individuals also sustained wounds to other parts of their bodies. Mohammad Shamim, a 10-year-old who worked at a motorcycle workshop, sustained pellet injuries to both eyes during a clash between police and protesters last Friday in the Mirpur area of the capital. Doctors have said he will never fully recover his vision. “My son’s future looks grim. What am I going to do with him?” lamented his father, Mohammad Idris. NIOH’s director, Golam Mostafa, confirmed that shotgun pellets used during the anti-quota protests were the primary cause of the injuries. “In cases where the pellet embeds itself in the retina’s centre or is forcefully ejected upon impact, partial blindness becomes the tragic outcome,” he said. Researchers who looked at pellet injuries to protesters in Indian-administered Kashmir have previously found [PDF] that when fired at close range, the pellets lack sufficient time to disperse, resulting in a concentrated cluster that moves at incredibly high speeds. This concentrated force transforms the pellets into projectiles akin to handgun bullets, capable of piercing deep into soft tissues, particularly the eyes, causing extensive and irreversible damage. The devastating impact of pellet guns on eyesight hinges on the velocity and distance at which the pellets are fired, the study explained. The severity of these injuries has prompted international condemnation, with Amnesty International calling for a ban on their use for crowd control in Indian-administered Kashmir a few years ago. The United Nations has warned against using metal pellets, like those expelled from shotguns, in law enforcement, arguing that they are inherently inaccurate and often violate the principles of necessity and proportionality. Bangladeshi police and security forces however have resorted to using 12-gauge pump-action shotguns loaded with cartridges containing these very metal pellets, a number of security analysts told Al Jazeera after analysing several photos and footage. Al Jazeera telephoned and sent text messages to Home Minister Asaduzzaman Khan and several top officials from the police forces but received no response. Salim Mahmud, secretary of information and research of the ruling Awami League party, told Al Jazeera that he had to “check with the police and paramilitary forces” whether “any lethal weapon” was used against the protesters. Meanwhile, the US-based Human Rights Watch has accused Bangladesh’s security forces of using excessive force during the protests. Their findings reveal the use of live ammunition, tear gas, stun grenades, rubber bullets, and shotgun pellets to disperse demonstrators. Amnesty International has also raised similar concerns. Those who sustained eye injuries during the recent anti-quota protests, along with their families, claim that the police used indiscriminate force, firing at them without restraint. Rakibul Ahsan from the southern district of Barisal was part of the protests. A fourth-year statistics student at BM College, Ahsan was on the streets with his classmates last Tuesday when he was shot in both eyes. Doctors have not assured him of a full recovery. “We were protesting for a legitimate cause and were shot at for it. There is no justice here,” Ahsan lamented. Sumon Mia, a mason from Madaripur who shared a hospital ward with salesman Anik, was also struck by a pellet in his right eye. But unlike Ahsan, and like Anik, he was not involved in the agitation against the government — he was simply heading home from work. Despite a surgery, doctors couldn’t save that eye — his vision is lost. “My brother wasn’t involved in any protests. Why was he shot? Who will be held accountable for this?” his sister, Lipi Akter, asked.",2024,7
https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/7/28/bangladesh-restores-mobile-internet-after-11-day-blackout-to-quell-protests,7/28/2024,"Bangladesh has restored mobile internet, 11 days after a nationwide blackout was imposed to contain deadly protests over quotas in government jobs. The South Asian nation’s 4G mobile internet services resumed on Sunday, hours after Zunaid Ahmed Palak, the state minister for telecommunications and information communication technology, made the announcement.     “We have decided to restore the 4G network connectivity from 3pm [09:00 GMT] today,” the state minister said, following a meeting with internet service providers (ISP) and other stakeholders in the capital Dhaka. Social media platforms such as WhatsApp, Facebook, TikTok and YouTube, however, remain restricted. The broadband internet connectivity was restored on Tuesday, but a vast majority of internet users in Bangladesh rely on mobile devices to connect with the world. On July 17, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina’s government had suspended mobile internet services, deployed the army and imposed a curfew after tens of thousands of students hit the streets, demanding reforms in the quota system which reserved 30 percent of government jobs for relatives of veterans who fought in the 1971 war of independence against Pakistan. The protests – one of the biggest upheavals of Hasina’s 15-year tenure – remained largely peaceful until the demonstrators were attacked by the police and pro-government student groups last week. Home Minister Asaduzzaman Khan on Sunday said at least 147 people were killed during the violence, in the government’s first toll, published a day after the main protester group, Students Against Discrimination, gave its own preliminary count of at least 266 dead. Speaking to reporters in Dhaka, Khan said the deceased included students, police, activists, and people from various professions, adding that further investigation is under way to determine the total death toll. Independent estimates put the toll at more than 200.    Home Minister Khan told reporters that police operated with restraint and only fired on demonstrators to protect government buildings. He added that police had only abducted some protesters for their own safety. “Despite the killing of their fellow officers, they showed extreme levels of patience,” he said. “But when they saw that the properties could not be protected, then police were forced to open fire.” The students opposed to the quota system have called it discriminatory and began their peaceful protests after a High Court bench in June reinstated the quotas that were abolished in 2018. With around 18 million young Bangladeshis out of work, according to government figures, the move to restore the quotas deeply upset graduates facing an acute employment crisis. Critics say the quota is used to stack public jobs with loyalists to the ruling Awami League party. Amid the protests, the country’s Supreme Court cut the 30 percent quota for veterans’ descendants to 5 percent, and the quota for ethnic minorities, transgender people and disabled people was limited to 2 percent. But the top court fell short of the protesters’ demands to scrap the quotas entirely.      Army patrols and a nationwide curfew remain in place, more than a week after they were imposed. Schools and other educational institutions remain closed until further notice. In a bid to restore normalcy, the government relaxed the curfew for 11 hours (6am to 5pm) in Dhaka as of Sunday and set new timings for office work from 9 am to 3 pm for the next three days, according to the Home Ministry, the dpa news agency reported. Meanwhile, a police dragnet has scooped up thousands of protesters, including at least half a dozen student leaders. Members of Students Against Discrimination said they would end their weeklong protest moratorium, but vowed to renew it if their leaders are not freed. The group’s chief Nahid Islam and others “should be freed and the cases against them must be withdrawn”, group member Abdul Hannan Masud told reporters in an online briefing late on Saturday. “Otherwise, Students Against Discrimination will be forced to launch tough protests” from Monday, Masud said.",2024,7
https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2024/7/26/dhakas-rickshaw-pullers-turn-life-savers-during-bangladesh-quota-protests,7/26/2024,"Dhaka, Bangladesh – The air crackled with tension in Mouchak, a central district of Bangladesh’s capital Dhaka. It was Friday, July 19, and the streets were already filled with tens of thousands of protesters, their fury heightened by the deadly events of the previous day. A brutal police crackdown and clashes with activists of the governing Awami League party had claimed the lives of dozens of students, pushing the city to its limits. The usual tranquility of the weekly Jummah prayer, a time for Muslim peaceful reflection, was hours away. Right then, the atmosphere was charged with unrest. Police, overwhelmed and outnumbered, retreated amid a barrage of stones, using tear gas and sound grenades in a desperate bid to maintain control amid mounting chaos.     A group of rickshaw pullers found themselves caught in the fray. A tear gas shell flew towards them, prompting a hasty retreat towards the nearby Malibagh Circle, a bustling avenue. Their retreat was accompanied by defiant voices raised in protest against the authorities: “If anything happens to us [rickshaw pullers], we will ignite fires in every house!” Among them was Shaheen, originally from Cumilla district some 180km (112 miles) away. “It was a horrifying scene,” he recounted, his voice trembling, the memory still vivid in his mind. “The police were firing at the protesters, who were retaliating by throwing stones. I managed to escape unharmed by pedalling my rickshaw as fast as possible to save my life.” Yet, the rickshaw pullers didn’t just escape — they saved lives as Bangladesh descended into the bloodiest clashes it has seen in years. What had begun as a student-led protest for quota reforms in government jobs had erupted into a nationwide upheaval, fuelled by escalating violence and broader frustrations with the government. In a span of just five days, from July 16 to July 20, Bangladesh descended into turmoil. At least 197 people were killed amid widespread protests and a harsh crackdown by law enforcement forces. Following the deaths of numerous protesters on July 18, tensions soared, prompting the government to take drastic measures: an internet shutdown that it blamed on “terrorist activities targeting data centres and ISP cables”, and after fresh clashes on July 19 in which at least 56 more people were killed, a nationwide curfew that it only began to relax this week. Through it all, the city’s defiant rickshaw pullers were out on the streets. An estimated 400,000 to 600,000 rickshaws navigate the city’s thoroughfares on any given day. The protests, the shutdown of businesses and the subsequent, strictly enforced curfew dealt a devastating blow to their earnings: Shaheen’s earnings plummeted to 150 taka ($1.28), — compared to the 800-1000 taka ($6.8 to $8.5) he usually earns — barely enough to cover the 120 taka ($1) rent owed to the rickshaw owner. But staying at home amid the mayhem on the streets wasn’t an option. “What good is fear if we die of hunger?” asked Shahabuddin, a young rickshaw puller supporting his mother and sibling after his father’s passing. Venturing out amid the clashes was a matter of survival. “We brave the violence because we are hungry,” he said. “What is the use of living if I have to see tears in my mother’s eyes due to hunger?” On July 19, that survival instinct also helped save many others. Swapan, a rickshaw puller from the northern district of Mehendiganj, transported a man bleeding from bullet wounds in the Banasree area of southern Dhaka. “I took him as far as the Goran Tempo Stand, but he was bleeding profusely,” Swapan recalled. “I advised his companions to find an autorickshaw to get him to the hospital quickly since rickshaws are too slow. I didn’t charge any fare for it.” In Mohammadpur, Kashem, a rickshaw puller, undertook at least five trips to nearby hospitals, transporting injured students and civilians. “People were wielding sticks and hurling bricks, but the police fired live bullets, causing numerous injuries. I took it upon myself to ferry them to hospitals,” he said. Like Shahabuddin, Kashem said that he couldn’t afford to stay at home despite the risk of stepping out in the violence, as his family relied on his daily earnings. By Monday afternoon, as the city remained tense, Shahabuddin had earned a mere 50 taka ($0.43), less than the rent he owed for his rickshaw. He recounted a harrowing incident in Banasree, where he found himself trapped in a violent clash on Monday, saved only by the intervention of fellow rickshaw pullers. “There was firing from police and activists of the ruling party, and I was caught in the middle of the road. I couldn’t abandon my rickshaw as that would have meant owing a large sum to the owner. Suddenly, a few fellow rickshaw pullers arrived and helped me reach safety.” But the fear and exhaustion have taken a toll. Zahangir, a rickshaw puller, braved the streets for three days during the protests. Hours of pedaling, evading tear gas and confrontations, have left him drained and disheartened. “My face felt like it was on fire, tears streaming down,” said. Now the standoff must end, said Shaheen, another rickshaw puller. “This cannot continue indefinitely,” he said. “The lives of ordinary people like us have been put on hold. We seek peace.” *The last names of the rickshaw pullers have been withheld to protect their identities. ",2024,7
https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2024/7/23/bangladesh-protests-are-no-longer-about-the-quota-system,7/23/2024,"It has been more than 10 days now since the start of the protests against a government job quota system. Students and youth across the country have been demonstrating against what they see as an unfair policy favouring a certain group – children of “freedom fighters” in the Bangladesh war of independence. But after the government unleashed unprecedented violence, the protests have gone beyond the demand for cancellation of the quota system. A list of demands by students has been circulated in an underground press release.     1) The prime minister must accept responsibility for the mass killings of students and publicly apologise. 2) The home minister and the road, transport and bridges minister [the latter is also the secretary general of the Awami League], must resign from their [cabinet] positions and the party. 3) Police officers present in the sites where students were killed must be sacked. 4) Vice Chancellors of Dhaka, Jahangirnagar and Rajshahi universities must resign. 5) The police and goons who attacked the students and those who instigated the attacks must be arrested. 6) Families of the killed and injured must be compensated. 7) Bangladesh Chhatra League [BCL, the pro-government student wing, which is, effectively, the government’s vigilante force] must be banned from student politics and a student union established. 8) All educational institutions and halls of residences must be reopened. 9) Guarantees must be provided that no academic or administrative harassment of protesters will take place. That Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina publicly apologises for her disparaging comments about the protesters may seem a minor issue, but will surely be the sticking point. This prime minister is not the apologising kind, regardless of what she does. Regardless of the allegations that she has rigged elections, regardless of the fact that corruption has been at an all-time high during her tenure, regardless of the fact that more than 100 students and other protesters have been murdered by her goons and the security forces, regardless of the fact that she has deemed all those who oppose her views to be “razakars” (collaborators of the Pakistani occupation army in 1971). There is certainly not anyone in the negotiating camp who would have the temerity to even suggest such a course for the prime minister. There is a Bangla saying, “You only have one head on your neck.” The ministers do the heavy lifting. They control the muscles in the streets and “manage” things when resistance brews. The ministers are high-ups in the party, and apart from the difficulty of finding suitable replacements, discarding them would send out the wrong message within the party. Vice chancellors and proctors having to resign is an easy one. These are discardable minions. The perks are attractive and there are many to fill the ranks. The police being dumped is not as easy, as they provide some of the muscle, but “friendly fire” does take place. Compensation is not an issue. State coffers are there to be pillaged and public funds being dispensed at party behest is a common enough practice. The demand to ban BCL and associated student organisations in Dhaka, Jahangirnagar and Rajshahi universities is a sticking point, as they are the ones who keep the student body in check and are the party cadre called upon when there is any sign of rebellion. It is a vigilante group that can kill, kidnap or disappear at party command. For a government that lacks legitimacy, these are the foot soldiers who terrorise and are essential parts of the coercive machinery. Educational institutions being reopened is an issue. Students have traditionally been the initiators of protests. With such simmering discontent, this would be dangerous, particularly if the local muscle power was clipped. The return of independent thinking is something all tyrants fear. The cessation of harassment is easy to implement on paper. It is difficult to prove and can be done at many levels. Removing the official charges will leave all unofficial modes intact. Of all these demands, the apology is the least innocuous, but perhaps the most significant. It will dent the aura of invincibility the tyrant exudes. She has never apologised for anything. Not for her father Sheikh Mujibur Rahman setting up the Rakkhi Bahini, the paramilitary force which rained terror on the country. Not his setting up of Baksal, the one-party system where all other parties and all newspapers, except the four approved ones, were banned. Not the numerous extrajudicial killings and disappearances and the liturgy of corruption by people in her patronage during her own tenure. An apology to protesting students, while simple, would be a chink in her armour she would be loathe to reveal. Ironically, her father and the Awami League led the resistance against the Pakistani army during the genocide of 1971. The revolutionaries have now become our new occupiers. They insist Bangladesh is still a “democracy”. By now, the body count is impossible to verify. I try to piece things together from as many firsthand reports as I can. Many of the bodies have a single, precisely targeted bullet hole. Pellets are aimed at the eyes. International news, out of touch as the internet has been shut down and mobile connectivity severely throttled, say deaths are more than 100. Those monitoring feel that these numbers are a significant underestimate of the dead and missing. Government news report even fewer. Staff at city hospitals are less tight-lipped and can give reasonably accurate figures, but not all bodies go to hospital morgues. An older hospital in Dhaka did report more than 200 bodies being brought in. The injured who die on the way to the hospital are not generally admitted. Families prefer to take the body home rather than hand them over to the police. Bodies are also being disappeared. Police and postmortem reports, when available, fail to mention bullet wounds. The body of my former student Priyo was among the missing ones, but we were eventually able to locate him. A friend took him back to his home in Rangpur to be buried. Constant monitoring and checking by activists resulted in the bullet wound being mentioned in his case, though a deliberate mistake in his name in the hospital’s release order that was overseen by a police officer attempted to complicate things. Fortunately, it was rectified in the nick of time. Getting the news out has become extremely difficult. This piece is going out through a complicated route. I have deleted all digital traces to protect the intermediaries. The entire internet network has been brought down; a junior information technology minister has said that this is due to the “unstable situation”. Helicopters fly low, beaming searchlights downwards. There have been reports of shots fired at people. Tear gas and stun grenade shells become lethal when dropped from a height. A student talks of a body lying on the empty flyover being dragged off by the police. A friend talks of an unmarked car spraying bullets at the crowd as it speeds past. She was lucky. The shooter was firing from a window on the other side. A mother grieves over her three-year-old senselessly killed. A gory report of a human brain congealed on a tarmac is a first for me. The curfew has resulted in rubbish being piled up on the streets. The brain will be there for people to see, perhaps deliberately. The raid at 2:20 earlier this morning in the flat across the street was also in commando fashion. The video footage is blurry, but one can only see segments of the huge contingent of the Rapid Action Battalion (RAB), heavily armed police and others in plainclothes. They eventually walked out with one person, perhaps an opposition leader. Armoured personnel carriers prowl the streets. Orders to shoot on sight have not quelled the anger and people are still coming onto the streets despite the curfew. There is the other side of the story. Reports of policemen being lynched and offices being set on fire are some of the violent responses to the government-led brutality. Then there is the impact of the protests on the average person, as most working-class Bangladeshis live day-to-day. Their daily earnings feed their families. As a prime minister, who desperately clings on to a position she does not legitimately have the right to, and a public, who have been tormented enough, to battle it out, they are the ones who starve. Private TV channels vie with the state-owned BTV and churn out government propaganda. As I watch members of the public complain on one, I am unable to forget all the average people I spoke to – the rickshaw drivers, and even fruit sellers with perishable goods – who expressed solidarity with the students. Their immediate suffering, though painful, is something they are willing to accept. She has to go, they say.

https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/7/23/bangladesh-curfews-internet-blackout-batter-economy-amid-quota-protests,7/23/2024,"Dhaka, Bangladesh – During a nationwide curfew and with the army on the streets, an unlikely group of people gathered at Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina’s office with demands – not student protesters who have been seeking an end to job quotas, but industry leaders. The country’s top business owners asked Hasina on Monday to withdraw the curfew and restore internet service, which has been down for days as part of a complete communications blackout. They pleaded with her to have the army provide security for the Dhaka-Chattogram highway — the economic lifeline that connects the capital to the country’s main port city — amid fears of vandalism.     Hasina told them her government was forced to impose the curfew and deploy the army across the nation to “save lives and properties of people”. “It [the curfew] will be gradually relaxed,” she said. But for millions of Bangladeshi workers, business owners and thousands of companies, “gradually” might not be good enough. For nearly two weeks, student protesters and security forces have been locked in a tense standoff, and violent clashes have killed at least 146 people. The protests started out against quotas — primarily against the 30 percent of government jobs reserved for descendants of people who found in Bangladesh’s 1971 war of independence. On Sunday, the Bangladesh Supreme Court significantly shrunk the quotas, but the students have released a list of eight demands, focused on seeking justice for their comrades killed in the violence. The government-imposed curfew remains in place, as does the internet block. All of that has brought the economy to a screeching halt amid high inflation and fast-depleting foreign reserves. In the past five days, Bangladesh’s economy has suffered losses amounting to more than $1.2bn, according to an estimate by the country’s business community. Aside from the shutdown of almost all industries, there were economic losses due to vandalism and arson attacks, including on the country’s lone metro rail system in Dhaka, and the national television network’s premises. Speaking to business leaders on Monday, Hasina blamed the internet blackout on opposition parties, alleging that their activists had ruptured internet cables across the country. She promised the internet connections would be restored soon. The shutdown and communications blackout have hit the readymade garment sector the hardest. It is responsible for more than 80 percent of the country’s export earnings of over $50bn. All factories have remained closed since Saturday due to safety concerns, and the sector is suffering losses of nearly $150m a day, SM Mannan Kochi, president of the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association, told Al Jazeera. “The biggest problem is that our international buyers are losing confidence — a loss whose value can’t be gauged with just money as it will have a long-term negative impact on the country’s most valuable industry,” Kochi said. Steelmakers have estimated that in the past four days, their sector has suffered a loss of nearly $110m. Suman Chowdhury, general secretary of the Bangladesh Steel Manufacturers Association, said in a statement that because of the curfew, they couldn’t release raw materials from the port, resulting in the disruption of production. “Also, we didn’t want to put the lives of our workers in risk and asked them to stay at home,” he said. Production and distribution of pharmaceutical products have also been severely disrupted as medicine makers have been unable to receive imported raw materials from the Chattogram port and Dhaka airport. “Because of the internet shutdown, we couldn’t get custom clearance to release our products,” said Jahangir Alam, chief financial officer of Beximco Pharma, a generic drugmaker. “Our productions are disrupted as we lack raw materials now.” The growing ceramics industry also fears losing export orders worth about $8m per day, a local newspaper reported, quoting Irfan Uddin, secretary of the Bangladesh Ceramic Manufacturers and Exporters Associations. The internet blackout imposed on Thursday night has hit almost all businesses and industries. It has shut down e-commerce and f-commerce, which are Facebook-based businesses popular in Bangladesh. These sectors are estimated to be losing at least $5m in revenue per day. Shahab Uddin, vice president of the e-commerce Association of Bangladesh, told Al Jazeera that it’s not just the businesses that are taking losses. “People in the city got habituated to ordering everything online in the past few years. I also ordered most things, including groceries, online, and my daily life has become a struggle now.” Call centres are facing daily losses of at least $3m per day, Wahid Sharif, president of the Bangladesh Association of Contact Centres and Outsourcing Association, told Al Jazeera. More than two-thirds of the call centre industry’s revenue comes from serving global companies, and the reputational damage that this industry has suffered because of nearly five days of the ongoing internet blackout is “irreparable,” Sharif said. Officials at commercial banks said they might have to pay additional interest amounting to millions of dollars because of delays in scheduled payments. Zunaid Ahmed Palak, Bangladesh’s state minister for information and communication technology, told the media on Monday that the government was aware of the financial losses due to the blackout. “We are trying our best to restore the connection,” Palak said. “The repair work is going on, and it could be back at any time.”",2024,7

https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/7/22/who-were-the-razakars-and-why-are-they-central-to-bangladesh-protests,7/22/2024,"The Supreme Court of Bangladesh on Sunday slashed a controversial quota in government jobs that was at the heart of mass nationwide protests that swamped the South Asian nation in recent weeks. Student protesters were agitating against a quota system under which 56 percent of government jobs were reserved for select categories of citizens. Within that, their principal gripe was over a 30 percent quota for descendants of freedom fighters from the country’s 1971 liberation war against Pakistan.     The court shrunk that 30 percent quota to 5 percent, and the remaining quotas to another 2 percent, opening up the remaining 93 percent jobs for all other Bangladeshis. But the protesters have refused to end their movement until the government notifies these changes. They are also demanding justice for the more than 100 people who have been killed in clashes between protesters on the one hand, and a combination of security forces and purported members of the governing Awami League’s student body on the other hand. A countrywide curfew remains in place, with the military manning the streets. Yet, as the protests have grown, they have morphed from a reflection of a job crisis to a broader battle over identity in a country that is 53 years old but where a vast majority of the population was not born when Bangladesh secured freedom. At the heart of this is a term that the country’s prime minister, Sheikh Hasina, used amid the protests, and which set off an angry response from protesters: “Razakars”. The word means “volunteers” and is considered derogatory in Bangladesh as it refers to people who supported the Pakistani military’s operation to quell the Bangladesh liberation war and were accused of heinous crimes. So what did Hasina mean? Who were the Razakars, what role did they play in Bangladesh’s freedom war, and what happened to them after the country gained independence? And why is the term so controversial?  As protesters demanded that the quota for families of freedom fighters be scrapped, the PM pushed back. The quota system was first introduced in Bangladesh in 1972 – after the country became independent in December 1971 – by Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, father of Hasina. “Why do they have so much resentment towards freedom fighters?” Hasina asked in public comments. “If the grandchildren of the freedom fighters don’t get quota benefits, should the grandchildren of Razakars get the benefit?” The students pushed back, accusing her of trying to portray all critics and opponents as Razakars. They adopted the slogan, “Who are you? Who am I – Razakar, Razakar?”, along with another chant, “Asked for rights and became a Razakar”, which has become ubiquitous among the protesters. Hasina then doubled down in her criticism of the protesters, calling the slogans “regrettable”. “They don’t feel ashamed to call themselves Razakars. They don’t know how the Pakistani occupation forces and Razakar Bahini [Razakar Army] had resorted to torture in the country – they didn’t see the inhuman torture and bodies lying on the roads. So, they don’t feel ashamed to call themselves Razakar,” she said. Author and scholar Anam Zakaria said Razakar is a “loaded term”, evoking memories of war crimes, including the killing and rape of the Bengali population and other ethnic minorities in 1971. “It is used synonymously with collaborators and anti-liberation forces and thus also seen as antistate and pro-Pakistan. There is hence a lot of stigma, pain, and trauma that is evoked with the use of this term,” she told Al Jazeera. When the British partitioned India and created Pakistan in August 1947, the newly formed state consisted of two regions: West Pakistan and East Pakistan. East Pakistan was home to 55 percent of the total population, with nearly 44 million people residing there. Yet the country was governed, consistently, by leaders in West Pakistan. Over the following two decades, resentment in East Pakistan grew over the lack of resources and decision-making influence, leading the country to the brink of breakup by 1971. According to Ali Usman Qasmi, a historian at the Lahore University of Management Sciences, the Razakars were mostly Urdu-speaking migrants who moved to East Pakistan from what is today India during the partition and were part of an auxiliary force created by the Pakistani military to support its operation to quell the rebellion in the East. “The army needed local support,” he told Al Jazeera. “The student wing of the religio-political party Jamaat-e-Islami in East Pakistan provided them with men who believed that they must support the army.” Qasmi said the men who volunteered to help the military were useful because they were well-versed in the local Bengali language and familiar with the terrain. “Initially, they were only called volunteers and were part of civil defence. But from May 1971 onwards, they were formally organised into two different groups, Al-Badr and Al Shams,” he said. “They were trained by the military itself.” Zakaria concurred with Qasmi and said the Razakars were created by the Pakistani military to secure local support, insights, and intelligence on targets and locations. “While most of these belonged to the Urdu-speaking community, commonly referred to as Biharis, they also included pro-Pakistani Bengalis who stood for a united Pakistan,” Zakaria said. Hundreds of thousands of people were killed during the war of liberation, and thousands of women were raped and sexually assaulted. The government of the newly formed Bangladesh accused Pakistan of committing genocide. The Pakistani army was involved in a “brutal military operation” as it tried to keep control of the East, said Qasmi. And pivotal to its efforts were the Razakars. “Razakars were central to the way the military conducted its operations in 1971, including the accusations of war crimes that they allegedly committed,” he added. In one widely reported incident towards the end of the war when Pakistan’s defeat was imminent, the Pakistani military, with the help of Razakars, allegedly rounded up close to 200 Bengali intellectuals, artists, journalists, and academics, and allegedly shot them. “Razakars were alleged to be directly involved in this massacre. So you can imagine, they have a very dreadful image and a bloody legacy,” said Qasmi. The Indian Army entered East Pakistan and fought alongside liberation forces, eventually defeating Pakistan. Once the Pakistani military surrendered to the Indian Army, many Razakars were attacked and killed by locals, Qasmi said. “Razakars were at the receiving end of considerable violence as they were targeted for being collaborators with the Pakistani military,” he said. Some of them moved to Pakistan. But several Razakars who chose to stay back were promoted to senior government positions, said Zakaria. This resulted in a civil society movement in the 1990s, with these promotions being labelled as a case of “anti-liberation forces coming to power”. “As a reaction, a movement was launched to hold these people responsible for their crimes during the war,” she said. After Hasina came back to power in 2009, her government founded an International Crimes Tribunal, with the mandate to investigate and prosecute those accused of “committing genocide” during the 1971 war, including Pakistani army officials and local collaborators who were members of Al-Badr and Al Shams forces. Historian Qasmi said the tribunal’s procedures, which identified more than 1,600 people as suspects, were “remarkably flawed”. “The trials were seen as targeting political opponents, but it was still the first wave in which Bangladesh was seen as trying to provide justice to the victims of the 1971 war, and as a result, a number of Razakars were indicted and Hasina received a lot of support for it,” he added. More than a decade later, the latest protests show that the legacy of the Razakars remains a wound that has not healed — 53 years after the 1971 war of independence.",2024,7
https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/7/21/how-peaceful-bangladesh-quota-protests-morphed-into-nationwide-unrest,7/21/2024,"Dhaka, Bangladesh – For three days, Ahsan Habib, a private university student, was on the streets of Bangladesh’s capital Dhaka protesting against what he believes was a “violent assault” by police and ruling party supporters against common people like him. The student protests seeking reform of the government’s job quota system have morphed into nationwide violent unrest, with demands for holding the government accountable for the loss of lives over the past week.     On Sunday, the Supreme Court scrapped most of the quotas, saying that 93 percent of government jobs will now be based on merit. But student leaders have pledged to carry on with the protests, demanding the release of jailed protesters and the resignation of officials, including Home Minister Asaduzzaman Khan, who they say are responsible for the violence that left at least 131 people dead.    Al Jazeera spoke to medics and a network of journalists to compile a death toll, as authorities have not released casualty figures so far. Prothom Alo and The Daily Star, the two largest Bengali language and English dailies, have reported 146 and 127 deaths, respectively. More than 70 percent of the deaths have been reported from Dhaka, where streets are strewn with the remnants of thousands of rounds of tear-gas shells, sound grenades, shotgun pellets, rubber bullets and brick chunks. Aside from two policemen and two ruling party supporters, all of the deceased are either students or ordinary people. “We were fighting against bullets with brick chunks,” said Habib, who joined protests in Dhaka’s Mohammadpur area on Tuesday. “There were not only police, but also people from the ruling [Awami League] party who were wearing helmets and were firing live bullets towards us.” On Sunday, Habib’s parents prevented him from going out amid curfew and shoot-at-sight orders. Meanwhile, his close friend is being treated at a local hospital after sustaining severe injuries in the violence. “What will I do with quota reform now? This government has used so much violence to suppress us. We want justice for our fallen brothers and sisters,” Habib told Al Jazeera. Student leaders are also demanding an apology from Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, who initially defended the quota for veterans and whose party officials dubbed the protesters as “anti-nationals”. Protesters have called Hasina, who has been in power since 2009, an “autocrat”. The last two elections (2019 and 2024) were marred by vote rigging, widespread irregularities and opposition boycotts. “Of course, the quota reform alone is not sufficient now,” Asif Nazrul, a professor of law at Dhaka University, told Al Jazeera. “So many students and common people have died in this violent protest, which was definitely instigated by government at first. Someone has to take the responsibility for this tragedy.” As violence escalated, the government imposed a curfew from Friday at midnight for an indefinite period, with intermittent gaps of two hours so that people could stock up on essentials. The government also deployed the army in order to prevent the violence from spreading amid accusations of excessive use of force by the police against protesters. Soldiers were seen patrolling different city points and other districts on Saturday. But defying curfew, thousands of protesters, both students and non-students, took to the streets on Saturday with processions, blocked roads and highways and torched tyres and planks of wood across the country and in different parts of the capital. Rezaul Karim Rony, a journalist and the editor of the monthly magazine Joban, told Al Jazeera an overwhelming majority of protesters from the area where he lives in Dhaka were non-students. “The protest is no longer confined within students as general people have joined them spontaneously,” Rony told Al Jazeera from Mirpur in Dhaka. “As there is pent-up anger among the common people under the autocratic regime of Sheikh Hasina, people have taken these student-led protests as a platform to express their dissatisfaction.” Many establishments across the nation including important government buildings, Dhaka’s metro rail, and even a prison in the central district of Narsingdi came under attack from the protesters. Several ruling party offices and houses belonging to some of its leaders were also targeted. State Minister for Information Mohammad A Arafat told Al Jazeera that the protest has been “hijacked” by vested interests. Students, he said, were fighting for “legitimate demands” of quota reform. More than 50 percent of government jobs are reserved in the South Asian nation of 170 million. Protesters have been demanding the abolition of a 30 percent quota for the descendants of 1971 independence war veterans as job growth has stagnated and the cost of living has soared since the COVID-19 pandemic in 2019. Rony, the editor of the local magazine, agreed that some opposition leaders have joined protests and indulged in “vandalism”. But he said that the government’s characterisation of protesters was “misleading”. “>This is a protest of common people, by the common people now,” he said. On Saturday, Nahid Islam, a key organiser of the students’ quota reform movement, was allegedly picked up by plainclothes police from a house in the capital. Islam’s family went to the offices of the detective branch of police, but his whereabouts are still unknown. There has been a complete internet shutdown since Thursday, leading to an information blackout and disruption of normal life. Ridwanul Alam, a private sector employee, has been frantically trying to recharge his prepaid electricity meter since Saturday morning, as there is no electricity in his home. Alam first tried bKash, a mobile financial service, to pay the bill, but it didn’t work as there was no internet. His attempt to withdraw cash from an ATM was also unsuccessful. “I don’t know what to do. My home has no electricity amid an internet shutdown,” he told Al Jazeera on Sunday. Economic activities have also been completely halted. The customs house of Chattogram port – which handles over 80 percent of the country’s exports and imports – has not been able to clear any container for the past 40 hours. Journalists are relentlessly trying to secure ways to gather and file news. Muktadir Rashid, a journalist from the digital portal Bangla Outlook, told Al Jazeera that enforcing the internet blackout is akin to crime now. “It’s like the government is robbing the people’s right to know,” he said. “And this is a must in any democracy.”",2024,7
https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/7/21/bangladesh-court-scraps-most-job-quotas-that-caused-deadly-unrest-reports,7/21/2024,"Bangladesh’s Supreme Court has scaled back a controversial job quota system after nationwide unrest over the past week during which more than 100 people were killed, according to local media. Students have been demanding an end to a controversial quota system that reserved 30 percent of government jobs for descendants of veterans who fought in Bangladesh’s war of independence in 1971. They say the quota favours allies of the governing Awami League party, which led the independence movement against Pakistan.     The Supreme Court ordered that the quota for veterans’ descendants be cut to 5 percent, with 93 percent of jobs to be allocated on merit. The remaining 2 percent will be set aside for members of ethnic minorities and transgender and disabled people. Sunday’s verdict comes after weeks of demonstrations – mostly led by students – that turned deadly on Tuesday after groups linked to the Awami League attacked protesters. Campaigners have accused the police of using “unlawful force” against protesters. Student groups responsible for organising the protests have welcomed the Supreme Court’s decision but decided to press on with demonstrations until their key demands are met, including the release of those jailed and resignations of the officials responsible for the violence. Earlier, the government of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina imposed a curfew, called in the army and gave shoot-at-sight orders to quell the biggest protests since her re-election to a fourth successive term this year. Since last week, universities have remained shut and Bangladesh has been cut off from the outside world due to a communications blockade. Violence continued to escalate as police used tear gas, fired rubber bullets and hurled smoke grenades to scatter stone-throwing protesters. Home Minister Asaduzzaman Khan said the curfew, which was imposed before the top court ruling, would be eased for two hours for people to stock up on supplies before continuing for an “uncertain time”. Hasina’s previous government scrapped the quota system in 2018, but the High Court reinstated it last month, sparking a new round of protests and an ensuing government crackdown. Attorney General AM Amin Uddin told the AFP news agency on Sunday that the top court dubbed the last month’s High Court verdict “illegal”.    However, Hasina defended the quota system, saying veterans deserved the highest respect for their contributions in the war against Pakistan, regardless of their political affiliation. The attempt by the governing party officials and ministers to paint the demonstrators as “antinational” further angered the protesters. The cutting off of phone and internet connections created an “information blackout”, reported Al Jazeera’s Tanvir Chowdhury from the capital, Dhaka. The harsh crackdown has fuelled even more anger towards the government, pushing protesters to move beyond calling for quota reform to demanding the government’s resignation.    “It’s not just the issue of quotas right now. Many people died, property was destroyed, and there’s an information blackout,” Chowdhury told Al Jazeera. “We still don’t know the full account of the death toll and casualties from the last few days.” Ali Riaz, professor and political scientist at Illinois State University, said the protest movement “transformed” into an existential threat to the government, which called on protesters to await the outcome of the top court verdict. “Bangladesh is standing at a crossroads,” Riaz told Al Jazeera. “I think the government will survive politically speaking … on the other hand if the protesters can persevere, they might actually push the government to resign.” Hasina’s government has declared Sunday and Monday as public holidays, with only emergency services allowed to operate.",2024,7
https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/7/19/bangladesh-imposes-curfew-deploys-army-as-job-quota-protests-continue,7/19/2024,"Bangladesh has announced the imposition of a curfew and the deployment of military forces after days of clashes at protests against government job quotas across the country. “The government has decided to impose a curfew and deploy the military in aid of the civilian authorities,” Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina’s press secretary Nayeemul Islam Khan, told the news agency AFP, adding that the curfew would take immediate effect.     Police in the capital, Dhaka, earlier banned all public gatherings for the day – a first since protests began – to forestall more violence. However, that did not stop another round of confrontations between police and protesters around the sprawling city of 20 million people despite an internet shutdown aimed at frustrating the organisation of rallies.    Al Jazeera’s Tanvir Chowdhury, reporting from Dhaka, said the introduction of the curfew, which began at midnight (18:00 GMT on Friday) will only add to the public’s confusion and a sense of unrest in the country. “People weren’t able to go out the last two days because of the shutdown. Now you have a curfew, and the internet has been completely shut down since early yesterday [Thursday] evening,” he said. Chowdhury said the government hopes to keep “students and the public off the street” with the curfew because it senses it is losing control of the protests. He added that the protesters appeared to be in “no mood for compromise” while the government is “increasingly losing control of the situation on the street despite using paramilitary forces and police”. The student protests erupted after the High Court on June 5 ordered the reinstatement of a 30 percent reservation of government jobs for children of veterans who participated in the country’s liberation movement in 1971. Violent confrontations broke out on Monday after student protesters were attacked by activists of the Bangladesh Chhatra League, the student wing of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina’s Awami League party. On Thursday, thousands of students clashed with armed police in Dhaka. At least 11 people were killed, including a bus driver and a student, police sources told Al Jazeera. It was not immediately clear if there were deaths at the protests on Friday. Bangladesh’s Independent Television channel reported 17 more deaths on Friday. Somoy TV reported that 30 people were killed.  Al Jazeera has not been able to independently verify these numbers. The government has shut down all public and private universities and sent security forces onto campuses. It said it is willing to meet student leaders. Demonstrators said they want accountability for the killings before they discuss a possible compromise with the government.",2024,7
https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2024/7/18/who-are-the-protesters-demanding-an-end-to-job-quotas-in-bangladesh,7/18/2024,"Bangladesh has been rocked by student protests for nearly three weeks. Since July 1, university students have been protesting across the country to demand the removal of quotas in government jobs after the High Court reinstated a rule that reserves nearly one-third of posts for the descendants of those who participated in the country’s 1971 liberation movement.     Following the High Court’s ruling in June, 56 percent of government jobs are now reserved for specific groups, including children and grandchildren of freedom fighters, women, and people from “backward districts”. Student protesters have clashed with police and members of Bangladesh Chhatra League, a student wing of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina’s governing Awami League party. Six people have been killed and hundreds of others injured. The demonstrations are notable not only for their size and intensity, but also their demographics. “Look at who is protesting,” Michael Kugelman, director of the South Asia Institute at the Wilson Center, told Al Jazeera. “It’s not just a case of grassroots demonstrations led by the poor. These are university students most of whom are above working class … The fact that you have so many students who are so angry speaks to the desperation of finding jobs. They may not be desperately poor, but they still need to find good, stable jobs.”  About 67 percent of Bangladesh’s 170 million people are aged 15-64 and more than a quarter are aged 15 and 29, according to the International Labour Organization. “So you’re looking at a situation where there’s a significant working-age population,” Kugelman said. Vina Nadjibulla, vice president of research and strategy at the Asia Pacific Foundation of Canada, said the South Asian country faces an “acute job crisis for university graduates”. “The 30 percent quota will hit that group,” Nadjibulla told Al Jazeera, referring to the jobs reserved for descendants of freedom fighters. The protests stand out all the more because of the significant economic gains that Bangladesh has made in recent years. The economy has grown at an average of 6.25 percent annually over the last two decades. Poverty declined from 11.8 percent in 2010 to 5 percent in 2022 based on the international poverty line of $2.15 a day. In the process, it also surpassed its much bigger neighbour India in terms of per capita gross domestic product (GDP). Bangladesh has also seen a marked improvement in its human development outcomes and, as a result, is on track to graduate in 2026 from the United Nations List of Least Developed Nations. Despite those successes, “there is still a lot of inequality and poverty”, with at least 37.7 million people reportedly experiencing food shortages last year, Nadjibulla said. “The growth is not trickling down to the educated university students who are taking to the streets,” she said.  Kugelman said the country risks missing out on the opportunity to capitalise on its demographic dividend. “That’s the big issue. The stakes are particularly high,” he told Al Jazeera. Bangladesh’s economic rise stems largely from readymade garments (RMG) exports – predominantly to the West – and remittances from workers abroad. “It is struggling to find a comparable” sector to RMG, said Kugelman. “It needs ways to attract more FDI [foreign direct investments] to spark and sustain newer sectors. If you create more sectors and more diverse exports, jobs will follow.” Nadjibulla said the government needs to ensure there is appropriate education and training to match the needs of the workforce. Last year, about 40 percent of Bangladeshis aged 15-24 were not working, studying or training. Nadjibulla said the efforts of global businesses to expand their supply chains beyond China could be an opportunity for Bangladesh. “That is where education reforms become critical,” she said. “What we are seeing right now is a complex interplay of government shortcomings, inequality and youth disenfranchisement and disenchantment with the government of Sheikh Hasina.”",2024,7
https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/7/17/police-fire-tear-gas-as-bangladesh-protests-against-job-quotas-rage,7/17/2024,"Police have fired tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse students protesting against the Bangladesh government’s job quota system in the capital, Dhaka, as authorities ordered the closure of all public and private universities for an indefinite period. On Wednesday, authorities deployed units of the paramilitary Border Guard force alongside riot police outside the University of Dhaka campus as students chanted: “We will not let our brothers’ blood go in vain”.     Police fired tear gas and rubber bullets and lobbed sound grenades at the students as they marched in processions carrying coffins in solidarity with those killed, Nahid Islam, the coordinator of the anti-quota protests, told the news agency Reuters. “Our protests will also continue no matter how much violence they can unleash on us,” University of Dhaka student Chamon Fariya Islam told the AFP news agency. The job quotas, which include a 30 percent reservation for family members of fighters from the 1971 war of independence from Pakistan, have caused anger among students who say the system benefits children of pro-government groups who back Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, who won her fourth consecutive term in a general election in January that was boycotted by the opposition. Students also say the quotas won’t fix high youth unemployment rates in the country, with nearly 32 million young Bangladeshis not in work or education out of a total population of 170 million people. Demonstrations intensified and turned violent after Hasina, the daughter of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, who led Bangladesh’s independence from Pakistan, refused to meet the protesters’ demands. She labelled those opposing the quota as “razakar” – a term used for those who allegedly collaborated with the Pakistani army during the 1971 war. On Tuesday, six people, including at least three students, were killed during clashes, police said.    Hasina has condemned the killings and insisted that perpetrators would be brought to justice. “I condemn every murder,” she said in a televised address to the nation on Wednesday evening. “I firmly declare that those who carried out murders, looting and violence – whoever they are – I will make sure they will be given the appropriate punishment.” Foreign Minister Hasan Mahmud added that the government was sympathetic towards the students and their movement and blamed the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) and its ally Jamaat-e-Islami party for the violence. Police also raided the BNP headquarters and arrested seven members of its student wing, in an effort to stop the violence. Detective branch chief Harun-or-Rashid told reporters that officers had found a cache of Molotov cocktails and other weapons at the BNP offices.    Meanwhile, internet users around Bangladesh reported widespread outages of Facebook, the main platform used to organise the protests. Online freedom watchdog NetBlocks said “multiple internet providers” in Bangladesh had completely restricted access to the social media platform in the wake of Tuesday’s crackdown. Rights watchdog Amnesty International and the US Department of State have both condemned this week’s clashes and urged Hasina’s government not to crack down on peaceful demonstrators.",2024,7
https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/7/17/bangladesh-students-defy-orders-occupy-universities-as-tensions-spiral,7/17/2024,"Dhaka, Bangladesh – Armed with sticks and cricket stumps, Mahin Sarkar stood guard at the gates of Dhaka University with fellow students. Anyone who wanted to enter had to show them identification proving they were from the university. Just outside the gates, several police platoons were positioned, one police officer said on condition of anonymity, to “prevent any further acts of vandalism”.     On Wednesday afternoon, Bangladesh’s oldest functioning university was a fortress with opposing forces stationed on either side of the gates and the prospect brewing of the tense standoff descending into clashes. The government ordered all schools and colleges shut down on Tuesday, a day after nationwide protests against a quota for government jobs turned violent with student activists of the ruling Awami League engaging in street fights against demonstrators and riot police unleashing tear gas. At least six people have died, and hundreds have been injured in the clashes, most of which occurred near or inside university campuses, the central hubs of protests against a quota system that many students insist is discriminatory. More than half – 56 percent – of government jobs are reserved for descendants of Bangladeshis who fought for independence from Pakistan, women, people from districts with poor socioeconomic indices, ethnic minorities and people with physical disabilities. The student protesters oppose the quota for veterans’ families. Yet hours after the order demanding that students vacate university premises, many students have refused to leave. Instead, they have hunkered down in their dormitories and occupied key locations on campuses. At Dhaka University, for instance, students have moved towards the area near the vice chancellor’s residence to try to pressure authorities to reverse the decision to shut the campus down. But hundreds of police and paramilitary officers were also positioned in the area near the vice chancellor’s residence, even as students chanted slogans, demanding they withdraw from Dhaka University. The university has given students until the evening to vacate the campus. But what happens if students don’t leave by then? Mohammad Shohagh Mia, a student, said he wouldn’t budge until the demands of protesters are met. He said they include not just reforms to the quota system but also freedom on campus from “the ruling party’s toxic politics”. “We want these commitments in writing,” Mia told Al Jazeera after activists of the Bangladesh Chhatra League (BCL), the Awami League’s student organisation, clashed with the student protesters on Monday and Tuesday. The student protesters have since driven BCL activists out of the campus. “We have liberated our campus from the Chhatra League, and we intend to keep it that way,” Sarkar said. Students in almost all other public universities have defied the eviction order as well. “We refuse to leave the campus,” said Abu Hasnat, a student resident at Rajshahi University, the largest public university in northern Bangladesh. “If we depart now, the government will suppress our protest.” In Jahangirnagar University on the outskirts of the capital, Dhaka, protesting students said they weren’t sure they would be able to return safely if they left campus. “The Chhatra League attacked us, and neither the state nor the university administration has ensured our safety,” said Arif Sohel, a leading protester at Jahangirnagar University. “Now, if we leave the dormitories and campus, we have no guarantee of returning home safely. Until justice is delivered for the assaults on us and the campus is rid of threats, we refuse to vacate the dormitories.” Meanwhile, leaders and activists of the BCL have pledged to deliver a “fitting response” to the students protesting against the quota system. Hundreds of activists from the student organisation participated in a funeral in absentia for one of their members who was among the six people killed on Tuesday near Dhaka University’s main gate. On Wednesday afternoon, these BCL activists positioned themselves along a key thoroughfare of the capital armed with hockey sticks and other makeshift weapons. Saddam Hossain, BCL president, accused the quota protesters of disrupting educational institutions and endangering the lives of other students. “In the effort to ensure the safety of ordinary students and preserve a conducive academic environment, over 2,000 BCL activists sustained injuries,” he told the media. He highlighted instances when BCL leaders and activists were assaulted and their dormitory rooms vandalised and attributed the vandalism to activists of student wings of the main opposition parties. He also declared that the BCL would respond to the attackers through both street protests and legal action. Independent observers said the current situation surrounding the quota protest has reached a deadlock. Talking with Al Jazeera, Rezaul Karim Rony, editor of Joban magazine, said that initially, many Bangladeshis were largely indifferent to the protests. However, the fatal violence on Monday has shaken people, Rony said. “I believe it has transcended mere quota reform at this point. People have found a platform to voice their frustration against the Awami League’s autocratic rule over the past decade and the erosion of their voting rights,” Rony added. Many rights groups have accused the Awami League of crackdowns on political opponents during its 15-year rule. Political analyst Zahed Ur Rahman said he expected the government to eventually resort to using force to quell the protests and regain control. “They have no alternative now because they understand that the protesting students are desperate due to the severe decline in employment opportunities and the country’s struggling economy,” Rahman told Al Jazeera. “Therefore, the government sees no choice but to employ force.” However, Rahman cautioned that such a move could potentially backfire on Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina’s government. “The events of the past two days have demonstrated the unpopularity of the current administration and the widespread dissatisfaction among the people. Taking drastic measures could further exacerbate their situation.”",2024,7
https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/7/15/dozens-wounded-as-students-protest-government-job-quotas-in-bangladesh,7/15/2024,"Violent clashes between people loyal to Bangladesh’s ruling party and demonstrators protesting against job quotas for coveted government jobs have wounded at least 100 people, police say. The quota system reserves more than half of well-paid civil service posts, totalling hundreds of thousands of government jobs, for specific groups, including children of fighters in the country’s 1971 war of independence from Pakistan.     Critics say the system benefits children of pro-government groups who back Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, who won her fourth consecutive term in a general election in January that was boycotted by the opposition. Bangladesh’s top court last week temporarily suspended the quotas, but protesters have promised to continue their rallies until the parts of the scheme they oppose are scrapped completely. Police and witnesses said hundreds of antiquota protesters and students backing the ruling Awami League party battled for hours on Monday on the Dhaka University campus, hurling rocks, fighting with sticks and beating each other with iron rods. Some carried machetes while others threw petrol bombs, witnesses said in a report by the AFP news agency. “They clashed with sticks and threw rocks at each other,” police official Mostajirur Rahman told AFP. Nahid Islam, national coordinator of the antiquota protests, said their “peaceful procession” was attacked by people carrying rods, sticks and rocks. “They beat our female protesters. At least 150 students were injured, including 30 women, and conditions of 20 students are serious,” he said. Injured student Shahinur Shumi, 26, said the protesters were taken by surprise. “We were holding our procession peacefully,” she said from her hospital bed at Dhaka Medical Hospital. “Suddenly, the Chhatra League [ruling party’s student wing] attacked us with sticks, machetes, iron rods and bricks.” Foreign Minister Hasan Mahmud said an “attempt is being made to transform the anti-quota movement into an anti-state one using the emotions of young students”. “The government will not allow an unstable situation to develop,” he said. Local media reports said the protests by thousands of students across Bangladesh began on Sunday night and continued into Monday after Hasina said the quotas were a matter for the top court. Hasina also reportedly compared the protesters to Razakar fighters, who collaborated with the Pakistani army during the war for independence. Students on Sunday night marched in a dozen universities and continued into early on Monday, protesting against Hasina’s comments and the quota system. Police on Monday said hundreds of antiquota students from several private universities joined the protests in Dhaka and halted traffic near the United States embassy for more than four hours. “Some 200 students squatted and stood on the road,” deputy police commissioner Hasanuzzaman Molla told AFP. During a news conference at her official residence, Hasina, 76, criticised those opposing the quotas for the descendants of the country’s freedom fighters, local media reports said. But the protesting students said only the quotas supporting ethnic minorities and disabled people – which reserve 6 percent of the government jobs – should remain. “We want a reform of the quota system,” a female student from Dhaka University said, asking not to be named for fear of reprisal.",2024,7

How: Follow Al Jazeera’s live coverage Bangladesh coach Chandika Hathurusinghe wants his team to make the most of their strengths in batting and bowling when they take on Australia in their Super Eights clash on Thursday night.     The South Asian side will face the 50-over World Cup winners at the Sir Vivian Richards Stadium in North Sound, Antigua to open their Super Eights campaign. “The pitches have been very challenging and very hard to read so our plan is to have a good start whether we bat or bowl,” Hathurusinghe said in his pre-match comments on Wednesday. “We are very happy to be here [in Super Eights] and then anything from here is a bonus for us so, we will play with a lot of freedom.” The Sri Lankan coach said his team will look to use the conditions to the best of their advantage. “It all depends on the conditions and a little bit on opposition as well. We will take their limitations into account and play to our strengths.” Australia’s captain Mitchell Marsh was coy about the composition of his side but revealed he will be available to bowl in the match if the team requires him to. The all-rounder has not bowled in the tournament yet. “It’s really important in this format to have [bowling] options and we are blessed with plenty of those,” Marsh told reporters on Wednesday. Marsh said felt lucky to lead a side loaded with experience with the bat and ball and will look to use it against a tricky opposition. Australia’s fielding was poor in their last group game against Scotland but Marsh said the team has put the “off night” past them. “This group loves to stand up in big moments so I have got a lot of trust in the group.” The Antigua venue has produced some of the highest-scoring matches in the tournament so far and any width from bowlers has been dispatched to the boundary. The toss has not played a significant role in the outcome of the five matches played at the venue and captains winning the toss have gone with a mix of bat first and field first options. The weather will remain overcast in the evening, with some passing showers forecast during the match hours. Australia hold a slight edge over Bangladesh in their 10 T20 meetings. The 2021 champions have won six matches, while the men in green have won four. Their last meeting came in the T20 World Cup 2021 and Australia thrashed Bangladesh by eight wickets. Australia will be buoyed by their unbeaten run in the group games and their ability to recover from tricky situations to win matches. Bangladesh seemed to have found form after a win and a loss in their first two matches, especially with the bat. Australia: W W W W W

Eight Rohingya Muslims were among those killed by mudslides in the early hours of Wednesday, Mohammad Shamsud Douza, a senior Bangladesh government official in charge of refugees, said. The disaster is the latest in a series triggered by extreme weather in South Asia and around the globe, with heavy rains and heatwaves having killed many people and caused humanitarian crises in recent months.     The refugees died in landslides in southern Bangladesh. More than one million Rohingya live in crowded camps in the border district of Cox’s Bazar, the world’s largest refugee settlement, after fleeing a military crackdown in neighbouring Myanmar in 2017. Amir Jafar, a police official in command of security in the refugee camps, said hundreds had been moved from areas deemed at risk. The Rohingya refugees mostly live in shacks made of bamboo and plastic sheets, often on steep, bare hills. The rains also unleashed chaos in northeastern Bangladesh. “At least 700,000 people have been stranded by flash floods and heavy rains in Sylhet district, and another 500,000 people in neighbouring Sunamganj district,” Abu Ahmed Siddique, commissioner of Bangladesh’s northeastern Sylhet district, told the AFP news agency. The Bangladesh weather office said it expected heavy rains to continue for the next few days. The nation of about 170 million people is among the countries most vulnerable to disasters and climate change, according to the Global Climate Risk Index. Just over the border, in neighbouring India’s state of Assam, at least six people were killed in floods and landslides on Tuesday night. “A landslide buried a woman and her three daughters alive,” a state disaster management official, Siju Das, told Reuters. “Their house was on a slope, and they died on the spot around midnight,” he said, adding that the bodies were retrieved after a three-hour search operation by rescuers. More than 160,000 people were affected by the weather conditions in Assam, with waters surpassing the danger level in the Kopili, one of the largest tributaries of the Brahmaputra, which ranks among India’s biggest rivers. More than 30 people in the state have died since the end of May in floods and landslides brought by heavy rain, officials said. Meanwhile, to the south, the country is sweltering under a vicious heatwave. New Delhi recorded its hottest night in six years on Tuesday, with hospitals in the city of 30 million reporting at least five deaths from heatstroke this week, the Times of India newspaper said.",2024,6

The 20-team competition has slimmed to eight teams and there have already been major shocks and eliminations in the group stages.     Here’s what you need to know about the next phase of the tournament: The top two teams from each of the initial four groups have qualified, with the most notable omissions being Pakistan and New Zealand: Following the four groups of five that began the tournament, the structure now reduces to two groups of four – the Super Eights. Each team will play each other once in their respective groups with the top two teams from each qualifying for the semifinals. The Super Eights will be played from June 18 to June 25. The tournament, which opened on June 2 at the Grand Prairie Stadium, Grand Prairie, Dallas, has moved from the United States and will now be fully played in the Caribbean. Four venues will be used in Barbados, Saint Lucia, Antigua and Saint Vincent. The semifinals will be played on June 27 in Trinidad and Tobago and Guyana respectively. The final in Barbados will take place on June 29. In an edition littered with shocks and upsets, including the biggest in the tournament’s history when USA beat Pakistan, every game appears to have an even greater value placed on it now. The USA, much as they did in the group stage, will open the next round against South Africa on Wednesday. The Proteas claimed four wins from their four games in the group but each was a tight scrap rather than the stroll the table may suggest. Their top order has failed to fire and USA will bank on pushing another of the global cricketing giants all the way. Fellow co-hosts West Indies, also one of our five pre-tournament favourites, face holders England in the second match of the Super Eights stage on Thursday. That is followed by India, the defeated finalist at the 2023 Cricket World Cup, against Afghanistan, now one of the dark horses for the trophy. Both matches are likely to set down the path that the two groups will take. By the time England play South Africa on Friday, we could be looking at an eliminator for one of the powerhouses. Australia must wait until Friday to begin their tournament and must beware of Bangladesh’s spinners in Antigua. The same will be true, if not more so, for Mitchell Marsh’s Aussies on Sunday when they face Afghanistan. The key face-off in Group 1 will be in the final round of Super Eights matches between Australia against India – a repeat of the 2023 Cricket World Cup and Test Championship finals. It is a match that is likely to decide first and second in the group, and therefore, seedings for the semifinals. Holders England follow up their opener against West Indies by facing South Africa in their second match before finishing against USA. The co-hosts’ match against the Proteas looks to be a clear eliminator by that stage – unless the USA can provide another upset when they face the defending champions. #TeamIndia Domination 👌 ICC Men’s Rankings Annual Update 👇 No. 1⃣ in ODI Rankings

No. 2⃣ in Test Rankings Send in your best wishes for the Indian Cricket Team 👏 🔽 pic.twitter.com/plOl9XBZUG — BCCI (@BCCI) May 3, 2024  India are the number one ranked T20 team. The tournament has been uncomfortable so far, though, and the matches against USA and Canada were more troublesome than hoped, while their Pakistan match went to the wire. Rohit Sharma’s men will be desperate to make up for the heartbreak of losing the 2023 Cricket World Cup final to Australia on home soil and will hope their players can take their form of the recently finished Indian Premier League into the final stages of this tournament. Australia can become the undisputed kings of cricket if they can unify the world titles by lifting the T20 World Cup. The Aussies lifted the World Test Championship in 2023, beating India at the Oval, England, before retaining the Ashes on English soil and then completing a whirlwind year by beating India in Ahmedabad to be crowned 50-over champions. A clean sweep of Test, ODI and T20 titles would be the most remarkable turnaround for a team that was humiliated by the sandpaper ball-tampering controversy of 2018. England’s defence of their T20 trophy looked as though it were heading for a similarly disastrous end as their 50-over title did last year. The washout in their opening game against Scotland was followed by a 36-run defeat by Australia and left them praying the weather was kind for their final two must-win matches against Oman and Namibia. The latter proved a nervy wait and a tight contest in a reduced match but Jos Buttler’s side scraped through. Carlos Brathwaite’s heroics in the last over of the 2016 final will still haunt the English when they come up against West Indies – both sides are targeting a record third T20 title – while the other Group 2 contenders South Africa can never be written off. The Proteas seam attack is led by fit-again Anrich Nortje, who holds the best economy (5.02) of any bowler at a T20 World Cup, but they will have to shake their hoodoo of never making it past the semifinal stage of a major International Cricket Council (ICC) tournament. West Indies, meantime, cannot be written off but have yet to be truly tested at this edition after coming through a group with Uganda, Papua New Guinea and a desperately below-par New Zealand. Here’s Al Jazeera’s quick walk through the history of the tournament.

How to follow: Al Jazeera will have live coverage from 11:30 GMT. When Bangladesh and Netherlands meet for their third group match of the T20 World Cup, the winners will walk away with a greater likelihood of qualifying for the Super Eight stage of the tournament.     Group D action now moves to the Caribbean, with the match on Thursday being held at the Arnos Vale Stadium in Kingstown, Saint Vincent. Both teams have two points each from their two games and are sandwiched between leaders South Africa – who have qualified for the Super Eights – and bottom two sides Nepal and Sri Lanka, both of whom are unlikely to go through. It leaves these two sides to battle it out for the second qualifying spot, and Bangladesh captain Najmul Hossain Shanto believes the side that tackles the conditions better will come out on top. “It is very difficult to say how many runs will be scored on this wicket, so it is very important to read the wicket quickly,” Shanto told reporters on Wednesday. He expects Bangladeshi fans to continue supporting them in the West Indies, as they have done in the US leg of their matches. “Wherever we play, [our] supporters will come, especially in the West Indies. It feels good.” Bangladesh fans will hope their team’s qualification for Super Eights does not come down to prayers. One fan asked the men in green to do their bit while the fans do theirs, with a placard reading: “You play, we pray” during their match against South Africa. The Netherlands are also aware of the importance of the clash and their bowler Logan van Beek said the team have had “very nice” preparations ahead of it. “This is the biggest match that we are probably going to play for this tournament,” van Beek said. He said he expects the wicket to be flat, with no dents but the ground still has plenty of “unknowns” for both sides. The men in orange are confident of bagging an important win over their group rivals. “The confidence that we’ve got over the last few years of beating big teams at big competitions and in do-or-die matches, we’ve stood up at right times and that’s how the Dutch play. We kind of find ourselves in these do-or-die matches all year round and so we’re used to that pressure and excited to do it again.” The Arnos Vale Stadium has plenty of unknowns surrounding it as it has not hosted an international cricket match in 10 years. In the past, the pitch has produced an even contest between bat and ball, with spinners finding plenty of success. While there is no rain forecast, weather conditions will be typically hot and humid. The two sides have met four times in the T20 format. Bangladesh have won three of those matches, including the most recent one at the T20 World Cup 2022. The only T20 win for the Netherlands against Bangladesh came in 2012. Both sides have won one each and lost one game – against South Africa – in the tournament so far. Bangladesh have relied on their power-hitting batters and calm lower-order veteran Mahmudullah to see them through with the bat. Rishad Hossain has also played an invaluable role with the ball. The Netherlands have been tidy with the ball and excellent on the field. All they need is for their batting to step up a gear. Bangladesh: L W W L L

After 12 days and at least two rounds of group matches at the ICC T20 World Cup 2024, one team from each of the four groups has qualified for the Super Eight stage, four teams are already out of the race and the rest of the 12 teams will fight it out for the four remaining spots.     Some of these 12 sides stand half a step away from crossing over to the next stage of the tournament, while others have their fates hanging by a thread, a favourable weather forecast and their net run rates. Al Jazeera breaks down the various scenarios for all four groups and the 20 teams at the end of the round of matches on June 12. All the teams in the tournament-opening group have now played three matches each. The group moves to Florida for its last run of matches, but plenty of rain is forecast in the Sunshine State, which could dampen the chances of some of the teams. Matches: 3

https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2024/6/11/bangladeshs-missing-billionaires-a-wealth-boom-and-stark-inequality,6/11/2024,"Dhaka, Bangladesh: Abutting the posh Gulshan Club and overlooking the serene Gulshan Lake in Bangladesh’s capital Dhaka, a 14-storey building is nearing completion. Construction workers clad in orange helmets and neon harness belts are detailing the finishing touches as the building’s ornate facade glistens against its monochromatic concrete and glass backbone.     This building, known simply as Three, is being constructed by the elite Bangladeshi real estate developer BTI and is arguably the most expensive residential apartment building ever built in the South Asian nation. Aside from having the most sought-after zip code, the 12 apartments – each spanning a whole floor of more than 7,000sq-foot (650sq-metre) – are stocked with a range of modern amenities and gadgets, including biometric security systems for locks and elevators and AI-based lighting for efficiency. All the apartments were sold even before the construction started, even with a whopping base price tag of 200 million taka or $2.5m until 2021 (the taka has since devalued, bringing the price of the apartments down to $1.8m). Since BTI chairman Faizur Rahman Khan also bought a flat in the building, the company carefully screened the other potential owners from the more than 50 applications it received, predominantly from businessmen in the city. Bangladesh’s rising disposable income is not unknown. Crowded shopping malls, such as Jamuna Future Park, one of the largest in South Asia, and new billboards advertising everything from packaged foods to cars and smartphones are all evidence of it. But this BTI building, perhaps more than anything else, speaks of the growing wealth of Bangladesh’s rich, a handful of the country’s 180 million people. A Boston Consulting Group (BCG) study indicated that, while the nation’s middle-income and affluent consumer (MAC) class is expanding rapidly – predicted to reach 17 percent of the population by 2025, the country’s wealth disparity is simultaneously deepening. It is a symptom of the nation transitioning from an “economic basket case” – as it was once called by former US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger – to a fast-growing economy, but one grappling with a growing divide between rich and poor. In Bangladesh, the wealthiest 10 percent of the population now controls a disproportionate 41 percent of the nation’s total income, while the bottom 10 percent receives a meagre 1.31 percent, according to government data. New York-based research firm Wealth-X identified Bangladesh as the global leader in wealth growth from 2010 to 2019. The study (PDF) indicated a remarkable 14.3 percent annual increase in the number of individuals with a net worth exceeding $5m, surpassing Vietnam, which ranked second with a 13.2 percent growth rate. Wealth-X’s report further forecasts Bangladesh to be among the top five fastest-growing countries for high net-worth individuals, projecting an 11.4 percent increase over the next five years. Further illustrating the growth of Bangladesh’s wealthiest, according to Bangladesh Bank data, by the end of 2023, more than 113,586 private bank accounts held at least 10 million taka (nearly $1m), a significant increase from just 16 such accounts after the country’s independence in 1971 and 3,442 accounts in the year 2000, around the start of the country’s manufacturing and export boom which helped power many of these accounts. This group, colloquially known as kotipotis, represents less than 1 percent of total bank accounts, yet controls a substantial 43.35 percent of total deposits, highlighting the concentration of wealth within a small segment of the population.  Economist MM Akash put it bluntly: “Bangladeshi rich people are increasingly getting wealthy while the poor are struggling for survival.” The disparity is hard to miss. Less than 3km (about 2 miles) from the Three building, along the same Gulshan Lake, lies Korail, Dhaka’s largest slum. Spanning an area equivalent to 40 football fields, Korail is set in stark contrast to its affluent neighbour, with four to five people crammed into tiny 100sq-foot (9sq-metre) rooms. In recent years, COVID pandemic-induced lockdowns, the Ukraine-Russia war, and the subsequent economic slowdown have pushed more Bangladeshis into poverty. Surveys by various organisations have consistently reported a substantial rise in poor and extremely poor individuals. A post-COVID survey by the Bangladesh Institute of Development Studies (BIDA) revealed that approximately 51 percent of Dhaka’s impoverished residents were pushed into extreme poverty due to the coronavirus pandemic. Akash attributed this widening gap between rich and poor not only to an unequal distribution of economic gains, but also to a development strategy that has disproportionately benefitted the ultrarich. The country’s Eighth Five-Year Plan acknowledged policy failures contributing to persistent inequality and the lack of equitable wealth distribution. A prime example, said Akash, is Bangladesh’s tax-to-gross domestic product (GDP) ratio of 9 percent, well below the average of developing countries of 15 percent. “We have a regressive direct taxation on the poor and middle class while we allow the rich to practise widespread tax evasion,” he says, adding that a significant portion of the wealthy’s assets remains untaxed. Khondaker Golam Moazzem, research director at Dhaka-based think tank Centre for Policy Dialogue (CPD), also criticised successive governments for prioritising corporate interests by reducing taxes instead of taxing the wealthy. “The irony is, here, workers are facing suppression when demanding fair wages, while at the same time, the ultra-rich are getting better benefits even after tax evasion.” A Ministry of Finance study suggested that a staggering 45-65 percent of Bangladesh’s income remains untaxed. This is largely due to the superrich’s ability to evade taxes by registering their assets – when they do – at a much lower value than the market price. Consequently, a significant portion of government revenue comes from indirect taxes, like VAT, which burden the poor disproportionately. Moazzem said the poor bear a heavier tax burden than the wealthy. He also rejected the “supply-side” theory that claims tax breaks for the rich ultimately benefit everyone. Echoing Moazzem, economist Akash also challenged the notion that a growing number of affluent individuals indicates a thriving economy – as the government sometimes tries to portray. “This is because most of those rich people in Bangladesh do not reinvest their wealth, rather stash them in off-shore accounts to evade taxes,” he said. According to Oxfam’s 2023 Annual Inequality Report, the richest 1 percent globally amassed nearly twice as much wealth as the rest of the world combined over the past two years.  Billionaires’ wealth has skyrocketed since 2020, with the uber-rich amassing an astonishing $26 trillion (63 percent) of all new wealth created during the pandemic and cost-of-living crisis, while the remaining 99 percent shared only $16 trillion (37 percent). This means a billionaire gained roughly $1.7m for every $1 earned by someone in the bottom 90 percent. Their fortunes have grown by an average of $2.7bn daily, further exacerbating the wealth gap. Paradoxically, despite being the world’s 35th largest economy, there were no Bangladeshi billionaires on the annual Forbes World’s Billionaires List until this year. Muhammad Aziz Khan, chairman of Bangladesh’s Summit Group, who made his fortune through electricity and energy trade, was the first Bangladeshi to make it to Forbes’s list. Just to put it into context, Eswatini, an African nation with a GDP 100 times smaller than Bangladesh, has one billionaire. Furthermore, out of the 76 countries with at least one billionaire, 40 have smaller economies than Bangladesh. Chile, for example, has an economy roughly 78 percent the size of Bangladesh’s but boasts seven billionaires. Similarly, Cyprus has four billionaires despite its economy being just one-15th the size of Bangladesh. Journalist Sheikh Rafi Ahmed, who reports on these “missing billionaires”, contended that many billionaires actually do exist in Bangladesh, but conceal their wealth in offshore accounts and real estate, pointing at the 11 Bangladeshis listed in the Pandora Papers for such practices. Rafi believed that substantial capital outflows and tax evasion have hindered an accurate estimation of individual wealth in Bangladesh. “This probably explains the absence of Bangladeshi billionaires for long on global lists,” he said. Naznin Ahmed of the Bangladesh Institute of Development Studies (BIDS) pointed to the alarming rate of capital outflow through over- and under-invoicing of imports and exports. The magnitude of the outflow of wealth from Bangladesh, as the ultrarich take their money overseas, was so significant that a 2017 Global Financial Integrity Report ranked the country highest among least developed nations for “illicit financial flows”. “I think Bangladesh has secret billionaires, but they just don’t keep their money here,” she said.",2024,6

How to follow: Al Jazeera’s live text and photo coverage begins at 11:30 GMT South Africa go into their clash against Bangladesh knowing a win will all but seal their spot in the Super Eight stage of the T20 World Cup.     The Proteas have had two contrasting encounters on the tricky pitch at New York’s Nassau County International Cricket Stadium, but they will take the experience of playing two matches when they meet Bangladesh on Monday. Should Aiden Markram’s side win, they will consolidate their top position in the so-called group of death which also includes Sri Lanka, the Netherlands and Nepal. But Markram is wary of the threat Bangladesh pose, especially with their all-round bowling attack. “It’s going to be a proper challenge for us [against] a really strong Bangladesh team,” the South Africa captain told reporters on Sunday. The Proteas have played all their matches in New York so far and have a slight edge over Bangladesh, who last played at the venue in a June 1 warm-up match against India, and Markram said the greater knowledge of the conditions will help them plan better. “We can develop plans [on] how to get to a score of maybe about 140 if we bat first and hopefully then our bowlers can do the rest.” Bangladesh enjoyed great support in their first match against Sri Lanka in Dallas, and Markram expects more of the same in New York but said his side will focus on the action inside the boundary ropes and not beyond. “I think there are quite a few South Africans living [here] – so for them to come out in their numbers and get behind us has been quite cool.” Meanwhile, Bangladesh’s coach Chandika Hathurusinghe said his team was “relieved” to have got over the line against Sri Lanka in their first match, but he expects them to perform better in their remaining three group games. “Lately, we have been inconsistent,” the coach said, blaming it on a lack of confidence. “Confidence plays a big part in T20 cricket and it’s a difficult format because you have to [be on the] get-go from the start.” Bangladesh’s batting has been poor in recent games but middle-order batters Liton Das and Towhid Hridoy have hit form in the T20 World Cup. Both batters were top scorers for the Tigers against Sri Lanka. Hridoy hit four sixes in his 20-ball-40. However, the conditions in New York will be different and Hathurusinghe expects batters to still find it difficult to hit big shots despite the recent improvement in the playing surface. “If they [batters] can’t adapt to the conditions, it’s difficult for them. [Their] success depends on their ability to adapt.” Hathurusinghe said the South African bowling attack can pose problems for his side but they are ready for “a good fight”. The much-talked about New York pitch seems relatively settled since its opening match between India and Ireland, although bowlers should still find plenty of assistance. The India-Pakistan game a day earlier saw both teams surpass 100 runs on the new surface that was unveiled for the match. The weather forecast is partly cloudy with a light breeze. Intermittent light showers could disrupt the game for a brief period.  South Africa enjoy dominance over their South Asian opponents in the T20 formats, having won all of their eight encounters comfortably. Three of these wins have come in the T20 World Cup. Bangladesh squeezed past Sri Lanka in their opening game, but only just. Prior to the World Cup, they lost a T20 series against co-hosts USA and won a closely-fought T20 series at home against Zimbabwe. South Africa were able to overcome a strong Dutch challenge in their second game, largely thanks to David Miller’s heroics with the bat. The game was played in New York and the Netherlands’ disciplined bowling had the Proteas on the ropes. Markram’s men won their opening match against Sri Lanka, in New York as well, with relative ease. However, they lost a T20 series against West Indies 3-0 shortly before the World Cup Bangladesh: W W L L W

https://www.aljazeera.com/sports/2024/6/8/crickets-biggest-rivalries-india-pakistan-england-australia-icc-world-cup,6/8/2024,"Some of the most thrilling encounters in sport have been between nations or athletes with historic rivalries that add an extra layer of anticipation and drama. In cricket, these rivalries range from sour relations stemming from decades-old conflicts to colonial history and some newly-formed bitterness.     The ICC T20 World Cup will highlight some of these top rivalries as in the tournament’s group stage and, perhaps, the Super Eights. Here is a look at some of the most thrilling match-ups in the history of the game: The clash that has been the biggest, quickest-selling and most anticipated match of every multilateral cricket tournament. The rivalry originated in 1947 when India was partitioned into two countries following British colonial rule. Pakistan and India have since fought three wars, and diplomatic ties between both countries have mostly remained bitter. On the cricket field, the head-to-head record favours Pakistan in Test matches (12-9) and one-day internationals (73-56) while India have the upper hand in T20 matches (8-3). When it comes to World Cup history, the scale is heavily tilted in India’s favour. Pakistan have never beaten India in the ICC ODI World Cup in their eight meetings and have only won once in their seven encounters in the T20 World Cup. Their last clash, at the Cricket World Cup on October 14, went India’s way again as romped to a seven-wicket win at biggest cricket stadium in Ahmedabad. The South Asian rivals will meet at New York’s newly-built Nassau County Stadium on Saturday, June 9 in front of a sell-out crowd of at least 34,000.   The oldest rivalry in the game – dating back to the 1800s – originated when a British newspaper famously wrote a condescending and racist article on Australia’s cricket team. It was set in stone when, in 1882, British tabloid The Sporting Times published a mock obituary of English cricket following their Test team’s defeat to their trans-continental rivals, saying “the body [of English cricket] will be cremated and the ashes taken to Australia”. The bitterness originated from Test cricket and comes to the fore during the Ashes Test series, but has carried on to all sporting encounters between both countries. In Cricket World Cup history, both teams have met on nine occasions. Australia have won six of those matches and England three. England’s first T20 World Cup title also came at Australia’s expense, when they won the 2010 final in the West Indies. Their second one was won in Australia, when they beat Pakistan to lift the title. The T20 Cup 2024 edition of Australia vs England is set for June 8 at Barbados. It started with a dance, specifically the “nagin dance”, in 2018. Bangladesh bowler Nazmul Islam had been doing the nagin (cobra in Hindi) dance to celebrate his wickets for some time, so when his side beat Sri Lanka in the T20 series in January 2018, he pulled it out again for all four of his wickets. Sri Lanka’s Danushka Gunathilaka did not take kindly to the serpentine celebration and did his own version to mock Islam when he dismissed two of Bangladesh’s batters. A few months later, the celebration gained traction during the triangular Nidahas trophy, which also included India. When Bangladesh recorded their second win against hosts Sri Lanka, their entire team broke out into an overzealous “nagin dance” celebration on the pitch. 2018 – Nagin Celebration by Bangladesh after knocking out Sri Lanka from Nidahas Trophy. 2022 – Nagin Celebration by Chamika Karunaratne after knocking Bangladesh out of Asia Cup. pic.twitter.com/Po7yhyeAb5 — Mufaddal Vohra (@mufaddal_vohra) September 1, 2022  The night ended with shattered glass in the visiting team’s dressing room and nothing has changed since. Every time both teams meet, there is no shortage of provocative placards in the stands and venomous celebrations on the field. In ODI cricket, Sri Lanka have won 42 of their 53 ODI meetings between both countries, while Bangladesh have won nine. They also hold the upper hand in the ODI World Cup, four wins in five matches. Sri Lanka have beaten Bangladesh twice in their T20 World Cup meetings, but the Bengal Tigers tamed the Lankan Lions with a two-wicket win in a thrilling match at the 2024 edition in Dallas. Afghanistan and Pakistan have been involved in a complicated geopolitical and cultural relationship for several decades and share a porous border that is often subject to violence and abrupt closures. The political tensions have translated into a fierce on-field rivalry, especially over the past few years as Afghanistan have swiftly built a reputation as world beaters. Several members of the early Afghan cricket team, including former captains Gulbadin Naib and Mohammed Nabi, picked up the sport while living in Pakistan as refugees during the decades of war and turmoil in their home country. Pakistan’s National Cricket Academy in Lahore hosted the players for training sessions. Some of the earliest coaches of the Afghan team also came from Pakistan. However, the historical tension between the countries has often come to the fore when the teams have met in recent years. Although Pakistan hold a 7-1 lead over their neighbours in ODI cricket and a 4-2 lead in T20 internationals, some recent matches have seen last-ball finishes that have gone Pakistan’s way. Fast bowler Naseem Shah has been a consistent thorn in the Afghan side by twice taking Pakistan home when a loss seemed certain. This mix of history and last-ball finishes has ended up igniting a fire in both sets of fans. Things got particularly ugly when Afghan fans vandalised the stadium and threw chairs at their Pakistani counterparts after losing a thrilling match in the 2022 Asia Cup. This came after tempers flared on the pitch when Pakistani batter Asif Ali angrily waved his bat at Afghan bowler Fareed Ahmad. The Afghans famously beat Pakistan at the ODI World Cup in India in November, sparking wild celebrations on the field and back home in Afghanistan. Both sides could meet in the Super Eight stage of the T20 World Cup, should they manage to qualify. While these two of the sport’s “big three” have been playing against each other since the 1940s, the contest picked up traction in the 1980s and became a full-on rivalry in the 2000s. Most of the heated exchanges and thrilling encounters have taken place in Test cricket’s Border-Gavaskar Trophy, especially since the famous Eden Gardens Test match in 2001 that saw India come back from a follow-on to win the match by two wickets. A heated exchange between Indian spinner Harbhajan Singh and Australian all-rounder Andrew Symonds led to the famous “monkeygate” scandal, which saw Singh get banned and then unbanned during the series. In the Cricket World Cup, both teams have met in the knock-out stages of the tournament in recent years. In 2011, India famously beat Australia by five wickets in a closely-contested quarterfinal to win the World Cup at home. Australia returned the favour four years later when they eased to a 95-run win in Sydney and went on to lift their World Cup fifth title.Both teams opened their 2023 campaign against each other in a thrilling tie on Sunday in Chennai, which India won by six wickets after a rocky start to their run chase. The overall ODI record of 150 matches still favours Australia, with 83 wins compared with India’s 50. The five-time champions have also won in eight of their 13 meetings in the Cricket World Cup and India have won five. In T20Is, India have won 19 of their 31 meetings and Australia have won 11. The two sides could meet in the Super Eights of the T20 World Cup 2024, should they qualify.",2024,6

What: ICC Men’s T20 World Cup 2024 Group D match
When: Friday, June 7, 7:30pm local time (00:30 GMT)
Where: Grand Prairie Stadium, Dallas
How to follow: Al Jazeera will have live text coverage of the match from 21:30 GMT. After a heavy defeat in their opening match against South Africa in New York, Sri Lanka will be desperate for redemption in Dallas, where they face familiar foes Bangladesh.     Sri Lanka were bowled out for 77 – their lowest total in T20 internationals – against South Africa’s pace attack on a tricky pitch, suffering a six-wicket defeat. The result moved Sri Lanka to fourth place in Group D behind leaders South Africa, the Netherlands and Nepal, who have all played a match each. It also dented Sri Lanka’s net run rate, which stands at -1.048, and the island nation cannot afford to slip up again. “We had a good chat with the boys and they have realised the mistakes they made,” Sri Lanka’s batting coach Thilina Kandambi told reporters on Thursday. “They are experienced enough to come back in this game. We have spoken about it – a lot of things, how we are going to play up … I think boys are pretty much up for it.” Sri Lanka and Bangladesh share an inane rivalry. Over the past few years and competitions, players have mocked and sledged each other on the field, adding more spice and drama to this contest. While Sri Lanka had a shaky start to the tournament, Bangladesh also have had a bad form in the shortest format this year. Bangladesh lost comprehensively against title favourites India in the pre-tournament warm-up match and suffered a shock T20 series loss at the hands of a fairly inexperienced USA side before the World Cup. However, Bangladesh captain Najmul Hossain Shanto insists they have put those losses behind them. “It’s very true that the top-order batsmen didn’t do well or they are not doing well. But tomorrow is completely a new day,” Shanto told reporters. “I think everyone is giving 100 percent in practice and if you talk about improvement, everyone is in a good condition. “Everyone is in a better position than before. Without worrying much about what happened before, tomorrow is a new day, we don’t know who will play well or who will not.” Shanto urged his players to “finish the game” once they get going. “We are working hard. The batters have prepared themselves, if we can execute it, it will be a good match,” he concluded. The result of Friday’s contest could play a big role in both sides’ odds of making out of the so-called group of death and qualifying for the Super Eight stage. Sri Lanka won the title in 2014, while Bangladesh’s best finish has been reaching the second round. The Grand Prairie Stadium in Dallas has hosted three matches, all featuring varied results. The first match was high-scoring, the next was low-scoring, while the third was an upset as the USA beat Pakistan in a super over after both teams scored 159. The pitch is still expected to be good for batting. The weather is forecast to be fair with no rain. Sri Lanka and Bangladesh have met 16 times in T20 internationals, with Sri Lanka winning 11 times. Sri Lanka lost by six wickets in their last World Cup encounter against South Africa. Before the tournament, they defeated Bangladesh 2-1 in a series in March and Afghanistan 2-1 in February. Bangladesh lost 2-1 to the United States in a series just before the World Cup at the end of May, while they beat Zimbabwe 4-1 in a series earlier that month. Sri Lanka: L W L W L
Bangladesh: W L L L W Sri Lanka are likely to play Dushmantha Chameera in place of either Nuwan Thushara or Maheesh Theekshana, depending on conditions. Sri Lanka’s batting coach has said they will not make many changes from the team that lost last time.

There are a few cricketers who entered the ICC T20 World Cup as relative unknowns but left the experts and fans in awe of their skills and potential by the end of the tournament.     Think, Shakib al-Hasan and Mohammad Amir at the 2009 T20 World Cup, Virat Kohli at the 2012 edition and Wanindu Hasaranga in 2022. Here’s Al Jazeera’s list of five young ones who could light up the 2024 edition of the tournament: Arguably India’s brightest young cricketer in the past year, Jaiswal has proven himself in the longest and shortest formats of the game. While the 23-year-old’s rags-to-riches story may have endeared him to fans, it is his batting and fearless approach towards the game that has put him in the limelight. Within a year of making his T20 international debut, Jaiswal has scored more than 500 runs in 17 matches at an impressive average of 33.4 and a high strike rate of 161. He has even managed to score a T20I century to go with his four half-centuries. The top-order batter is certain to open the innings for India with his experienced captain Rohit Sharma. And if India are to win a second T20 title that has eluded them in 17 years, a good portion of their runs may come off Jaiswal’s bat. In a country known for pushing young players at the deep end, Saim’s introduction to international cricket came relatively late. The left-handed batter played his first T20I at the age of 21 last year, but has been unable to plant his feet firmly in the playing XI. This has partly been down to his form, as well as due to Pakistan’s reluctance to break the opening batters’ bond between Babar Azam and Mohammad Rizwan. Saim goes into the T20 World Cup with plenty of experience of playing in the West Indies, where he won the T20 Caribbean Premier League 2023 with his franchise Guyana Amazon Warriors. Saim’s 52 was the highest individual score in the final and he ended the season second on the batting charts. While the opener has not been able to replicate his success for his country, Saim has the ability to hit unconventional big shots. He also offers  a possible left-right opening combination along with captain Babar. Most of all, his experience of playing in the region could make him a standout performer for the 2009 champions. Jacks made his international debut for England in 2022 as an off-spinner but goes into the T20 World Cup better known for his big-hitting abilities, thanks to his recent success with the bat in the Indian Premier League. The 25-year-old all-rounder averaged 33 at an impressive strike rate of 175 in his eight matches with Royal Challengers Bengaluru. He then followed it up with 57 runs in two matches in England’s recent T20 series against Pakistan. Coming in to bat at the crucial one-down spot, Jacks will provide England stability and power-hitting options as they look to win a record third T20 World Cup. Pathirana comes from the Lasith Malinga school of low, slingy fast-bowling action and he has the guru’s backing. “Matheesha, without any fears you can bring him in the last stages of an innings,” Malinga said in an interview with ESPNCricinfo. “His biggest weapons are his pace and his yorker but the biggest thing I see with Matheesha is his big heart.” The 21-year-old has 28 wickets in his 18 international outings for Sri Lanka but his recent performance at the IPL has helped raise his stocks as well. Aside from his 13 wickets in six games, it is his low economy rate, average and strike rate that made him a standout performer. The young gun could be Sri Lanka’s main weapon with the ball. Hossain is not so known in the international cricket arena but has quietly built a reputation as a miserly leg-spinning all-rounder who can get his side over the line with the bat too. The tall leggie has taken 15 wickets in his 17 T20s, but at an economy rate of 7, which makes him a rare commodity in the big-hitting format of T20s. The 21-year-old from Rangpur in northwestern Bangladesh could find plenty of assistance on the slow pitches in the Caribbean and may end up plotting Bangladesh’s path to the knockout stages of the tournament.",2024,6
https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/5/26/cyclone-remal-slams-into-bangladesh-coast-as-hundreds-of-thousands-evacuate,5/26/2024,"Cyclone Remal has smashed into the low-lying coast of Bangladesh as authorities evacuated hundreds of thousands of people from their homes, officials said. The storm started crossing the coast in the southern district of Khepupara in Bangladesh at around 8pm (14:00 GMT), meteorologist Shamim Ahsan told a news briefing in Dhaka on Sunday.     The cyclone, named Remal, was lashing the coast with wind speed up to 120 kilometres per hour (75mph), he said. Authorities have raised the danger signal to 10, its highest level, and the Ministry of Disaster Management and Relief’s Secretary Kamrul Hasan said people have been ordered to move from “unsafe and vulnerable” homes. At least 800,000 people have fled their coastal homes and have been shifted to cyclone shelters, government ministers and disaster officials said. But as people fled, Bangladeshi police said that a heavily laden ferry carrying more than 50 passengers – double its capacity – was swamped and sank near Mongla, a port in the expected path of the storm. “At least 13 people were injured and were taken to a hospital,” local police chief Mushfiqur Rahman Tushar told AFP. Bangladesh has set up more than 7,000 cyclone shelters and mobilised 78,000 volunteers, State Minister for Disaster Management and Relief Mohibur Rahman told Reuters. Cyclones have killed hundreds of thousands of people in Bangladesh in recent decades. In May last year, Cyclone Mocha became the most powerful storm to hit Bangladesh since Cyclone Sidr in November 2007. Sidr killed more than 3,000 people and caused billions of dollars in damage. The number of superstorms hitting its densely populated coast has increased sharply, from one a year to as many as three, due to the impact of climate change. India’s weather department said it was expecting the storm to make landfall in India overnight. India has deployed its disaster relief force in the eastern state of West Bengal and flights have been suspended at the major metropolitan city of Kolkata. More than 50,000 people in India have already moved inland from the vast Sundarbans mangrove forest, where the Ganges, Brahmaputra and Meghna rivers meet the sea, government ministers and disaster officials said. “We want to ensure that a single life is not lost,” said Bankim Chandra Hazra, a senior minister in India’s West Bengal state. Parts of West Bengal have started experiencing bouts of moderate rainfall, and the government has cancelled leave for employees in essential services, a civic body official said. The Indian Navy also said it had kept ships, aircraft, divers and medical supplies on standby for deployment if required.",2024,5

Best finish at T20 World Cup: Second round Former Bangladesh coach Stuart Law believes the South Asian team must “rethink” their approach towards the game to shed the title of perennial underachievers and leave a mark on the ICC T20 World Cup 2024.     The Bengal Tigers made their ICC tournament debut at the 50-over World Cup in 1999 and stunned favourites Pakistan with a 62-run win in the group stage. However, 25 years later, they are yet to win a match in the knockout rounds of a World Cup. “Bangladesh haven’t moved forward in 25 years,” Law told Al Jazeera ahead of the upcoming T20 World Cup. “Whatever they have been doing hasn’t worked, and they need to find out what needs to happen to make them tick,” the former Australian cricketer said. Bangladesh open their tournament campaign on June 7 against Sri Lanka, another South Asian nation that has made huge strides since their debut in 1975 by winning both the T20 and 50-over world titles. Law, who coached Bangladesh’s senior side from 2011 to 2012, believes that the way the game is administered in the country must change. “Maybe it is time to sit back and think, ‘This is the way we have been doing it, it hasn’t been working, we haven’t moved forward – maybe we need to do it slightly differently’. “That’s not talking down the current administration, but they need to look at all aspects of the game.” Bangladesh’s squad for the T20 World Cup relies heavily on the experience of their veteran stars Shakib Al Hasan, Mahmudullah, Najmul Hossain Shanto, Litton Das and Mustafizur Rahman. Law, who was in charge of Bangladesh’s Under-19 set-up until recently, says the young players coming through the system are not built strong enough to meet the big-hitting requirements of the T20 format. “They are not power athletes, but they are supple so they can bowl fast and they can bowl spin, we all know that,” he explained. “But they are never going to be powerful athletes like the West Indians or the Australians, who have different upbringings and diets. “If Bangladesh can nail that young development phase, get them in from the ages of 12 to 16 and give them a good diet and a good grounding of physical fitness, then the world could see a Bangladesh team that is untouchable,” Law told Al Jazeera. At present, Shanto and his side are reeling from a series loss against a fairly inexperienced United States side in their three-match T20 series ahead of the World Cup. The tournament’s co-hosts romped home to a five-wicket win against Bangladesh in the opening T20 and followed it up with a six-run win in the second match. Law, who played 55 one-day internationals and one Test for Australia, took charge of the US team a few days before the series. Prior to taking up his new role, the “Lawman” insisted that Bangladesh could fight its way to the top of the rankings if it provides the right diet, training facilities and opportunities to budding cricketers. “There’s so much talent – there are 171 million people in Bangladesh and they are cricket crazy,” Law said. “It’s just about unearthing them and forgetting about their social background and upbringing. If they have got talent, let’s start tapping into that talent.” Bangladesh won the ICC Under-19 World Cup in 2020 and have given stiff competition to regional rivals India and Pakistan at the Asian Games, with six medals, including a gold. Law believes improved the talent identification and coaching will help the cream rise to the top and from thereon, it can be fed into the senior side to take the place of the likes of Shakib, Mahmudullah and Mustafiz once they hang their boots. Until then, the older Bengal Tigers will have fight their way in what promises to be an increasingly competitive T20 World Cup. Shakib Al Hasan Arguably Bangladesh’s biggest player over the past 25 years, Shakib stands out even at the twilight of his career. Aged 37 going into the T20 World Cup, the all-rounder is crucial his side’s chances of success in what could be his last World Cup. Having made his international debut in 2006, Shakib has taken 699 wickets and scored 13,485 runs in all formats for his country. In T20 internationals he averages 20 with the ball and has a strike rate of 125 with the bat. Towhid Hridoy Despite only making his international debut in 2023, Hridoy has already established himself as a key batter. An average of of nearly 37 with in one-day internationals, with seven half-centuries in 26 innings, is matched by his strike rate of 132 from his 18 T20I innings. Mehidy Hasan Miraz A star of Bangladesh’s Under-19 team in 2016, Mehidy quickly established himself in the senior side with his left-arm spin and batting abilities. He goes into the tournament with decent domestic form and will look to put his experience in the Caribbean T20 league to good use.",2024,5

Chasing a modest 145 to win on Thursday, Bangladesh were well-placed at 78-2 before losing their last eight wickets for 60 runs to crash to defeat two days after losing the opening match by five wickets.     Fast bowler Ali Khan claimed 3-25 for the home side while Bangladesh skipper Najmul Hossain Shanto (36) and former captain Shakib Al Hasan (30) were their team’s main run-makers in a total of 138. “A lot of credit goes to the bowlers. They really put in the effort and brought their A game to restrict the Bangladeshi batsmen,” man-of-the-match Khan said. “We took wickets at crucial stages, and that put the pressure back on Bangladesh.” Ali Khan’s stellar performance today at the second T20i against Bangladesh earned him the Man of the Match title! 🤩🔥#USAvBAN 🇺🇸 pic.twitter.com/8ohdtVF3TG — USA Cricket (@usacricket) May 23, 2024  The series is being played as part of the build-up to the Twenty20 World Cup in the US and Caribbean, which starts on June 1. The final game of the series will also take place in Houston on Saturday. “I think it’s very disappointing for us. We lost wickets I think in almost every over in the middle,” Shanto said. “I hope we can play some good cricket in the next match. I think it’s not a problem with the skills. We should change our mentality and mindset.” After limiting the USA to 144-6 in 20 overs, Bangladesh were rocked after just four balls when opener Soumya Sarkar was caught and bowled by Saurabh Netravalkar without scoring. They were 30-2 in the fifth over when fellow opener Tanzid Hasan, who had been called into the side to replace veteran run-getter Liton Das, was clean-bowled by Jasdeep Singh for 19. At 78-2, Bangladesh appeared in control but lost skipper Shanto, run out in an embarrassing mix-up with Towhid Hridoy. His exit sparked a rapid slide by the Asian side, ranked at nine in the world compared with the Americans at 19. Hridoy was bowled by former New Zealand star Corey Anderson for 25 before 38-year-old Mahmudullah (3), the veteran of 130 T20s, was also cleaned up by left-arm seamer Shadley van Schalkwyk. The same bowler also sent back Jaker Ali, and when Shakib, playing in his 121st T20 international, had his stumps scattered by Khan, the Bangladeshis were 124-7 and staring at defeat. Tanzim Hasan Sakib was lbw to Khan.  Shoriful Islam fell to Netravalkar before Khan had last man Rishad Hossain caught behind to end the match. Earlier, US skipper Monank Patel top-scored with 42 off 38 balls and was well supported by fellow opener Steven Taylor (31) and Aaron Jones’s 35. Shoriful, Mustafizur Rahman and Rishad all took two wickets each for Bangladesh.",2024,5

Anwarul Azim Anar, 56, who won his third consecutive term in a constituency in the border district of Jhenaidah from the Awami League party, went missing on May 13, a day after going to India to seek medical treatment, according to his relatives.     Khan told reporters that three Bangladeshis had been arrested over the death. “We cannot disclose all information at the moment for the sake of the investigation,” the minister said on Wednesday. Anar’s body was found in an abandoned house in Kolkata’s New Town in the early hours of Wednesday, a deputy police commissioner in the city said. Bangladesh’s Foreign Minister Hasan Mahmud said police did not find the body in the flat where he was believed to have been killed, citing information from the Bangladesh Mission in Kolkata. A report on the parliamentarian’s disappearance was lodged by his relatives at the Baranagar police station in North Kolkata on May 18. According to the report, Anar visited the residence of a person named Gopal Biswas in Kolkata on May 12. The next day, he departed from Biswas’s residence to see a doctor. He informed his family that he would be back in Bangladesh in the evening. But he remained incommunicado since then, Anar’s personal assistant Abdour Rauf told Anadolu news agency.

Cricket’s shortest format serves as the backbone of the most lucrative leagues worldwide and is responsible for bringing new fans to the game with its slap-bang nature.     Here’s a look at the brief history of the competition and the moments that mattered the most: Host: South Africa
Final: India vs Pakistan
Winner: India – by five runs
Teams: 12
Player of the tournament: Shahid Afridi Predictably, this was a tournament of many firsts. There were 33 T20I player debuts, several individual and team records were set, and the world had its first T20 champion. Chris Gayle scored the first T20I century with his 57-ball 117 in the opening match against South Africa. Yuvraj Singh famously hit England fast bowler Stuart Broad for six sixes in an over and in the process, broke the record for the fastest T20I half-century (50 off 12 balls). India and Pakistan grabbed the headlines in two separate encounters. The rivals were locked in a tied match in the Super 8 stage, resulting in a first T20I bowl-out. Pakistan failed to hit the stumps in three attempts while India struck every time. A final for the ages then set alight the cricketing world: India vs Pakistan, last-over finish. Pakistan needed 13 before Misbah ul Haq brought the equation down to six off four. And then – Pakistan fans look away now – Misbah scooped Joginder Sharma to S Sreesanth at fine leg to set off wild celebrations. Misbah, shocked and heartbroken, remained on his haunches and India were crowned the first T20 world champions. Host: England
Final: Pakistan vs Sri Lanka
Winner: Pakistan – by eight wickets
Teams: 12
Player of the tournament: Tillakaratne Dilshan England’s home T20 World Cup got off to the worst possible start when they lost to the so-called minnows, the Netherlands, at Lord’s. The hosts still qualified for the Super 8s but that is where their campaign ended along with that of holders India and Australia, following two heavy losses. Pakistan recovered from a typically slow start to find themselves in the semifinals where Shahid Afridi starred against a South Africa left rueing another last-four stutter. Tillakaratne Dilshan’s unbeaten 96 off 57 helped Sri Lanka romp their semi with the West Indies by 57 runs. The tournament was held a few months after the horrific armed attack on the Sri Lankan cricket team’s bus while on tour in Lahore, Pakistan. The pre-final anthems were especially poignant. Teenage fast bowler Mohammad Amir removed Dilshan for a duck to set off a batting collapse that even Kumar Sangakkara’s 52-ball 64 could not resuscitate. Afridi duly obliged in the chase with another half-century before posing at the end in his trademark star-man celebration. Host: West Indies
Final: Australia vs England
Winner: England – by seven wickets
Teams: 12
Player of the tournament: Kevin Pietersen Scheduling changes meant that the West Indies hosted the 2010 tournament less than a year after the previous one. Afghanistan made their mark with an impressive debut amidst the continuing war at home. Australia found their typically unforgiving World Cup form on their way to the final. Needing 48 runs in the last three overs, Michael Hussey encapsulated the never-say-die Aussie attitude by dispatching Pakistan’s bowlers – Saeed Ajmal in particular – for four sixes and two fours. England’s explosive batting lineup powered its way to the nation’s first World Cup which Paul Collingwood, Pietersen and co lifted after a seven-wicket win in Barbados. Host: Sri Lanka
Final: Sri Lanka vs West Indies
Winner: West Indies – by 36 runs
Teams: 12
Player of the tournament: Shane Watson When the T20 World Cup finally arrived in South Asia, India – once again – fell short, despite beating arch-rivals Pakistan by eight wickets in the Super 8s. Instead, Pakistan were the team to progress on net run rate to face Sri Lanka in the semis. The hosts’ spin wizards Ajantha Mendis and Rangana Herath proved too wily for Pakistan as the Lankan lions roared into a home final. They were joined by the big-hitting West Indies, who beat Australia by 74 runs after amassing 205 – the tournament’s joint-highest total – thanks to Gayle’s 41-ball 75. In the final, Marlon Samuels capped an incredible year by scoring an unbeaten 78 runs while wickets fell all around him. The below-par target of 137 was enough as Sunil Narine spun a web to dismiss the hosts for 101 in 18.4 overs. The Caribbean side’s win was termed the rebirth of West Indian cricket as Gayle and co danced away to the Korean pop hit Gangnam Style. Host: Bangladesh
Final: India vs Sri Lanka
Winner: Sri Lanka – by six wickets
Teams: 16
Player of the tournament: Virat Kohli Hong Kong, Nepal and the United Arab Emirates made their T20 World Cup debuts as the tournament was expanded to 16 teams. The opening match saw the Bengal Tigers bag to a nine-wicket win over the hapless Afghanistan, but the hosts then lost to Hong Kong in one of the tournament’s biggest upsets. In the first semifinal, Sri Lanka undid two years of hurt by dethroning the West Indies with a 27-run win. A few hours later, Kohli showed his supremacy with the bat as his 44-ball 72 overcame a strong South African bowling line-up. Kohli’s blistering form helped India set a target of 131 but Sangakkara and Mahela Jayawardene – the leaders of Sri Lanka’s golden generation, who had been on the losing end of the 50-over World Cup final against India three years earlier – set things right. Kohli’s 319 aggregate runs remain a T20 World Cup record. Host: India
Final: England vs West Indies
Winner: West Indies – by four wickets
Teams: 16
Player of the tournament: Virat Kohli India hosted the T20 World Cup for the first time and with a squad packed with IPL stars, they were the outright favourites. To the delight of a packed Eden Gardens stadium in Kolkata, Kohli powered India in their group to their 11th consecutive win against Pakistan in an ICC World Cup. Kohli hit a 47-ball 89 to set a target of 193, in the semifinals, but could do little as Lendl Simmons broke more than a billion Indian hearts to send the West Indies through. The West Indies were reeling late in their chase in the final as England seemed to have done enough, despite a sub-par score of 155. Enter Carlos Brathwaite – a relative unknown – who was left facing the final over from Stokes. Nineteen needed off six balls. Six, six, six, six. Game over! The swashbuckling end left Stokes in tears and prompted West Indies legend Ian Bishop to scream on television: “Carlos Brathwaite, remember the name!” Host: United Arab Emirates and Oman
Final: Australia vs New Zealand
Winner: Australia – by eight wickets
Teams: 16
Player of the tournament: David Warner The first ICC World Cup in the post-pandemic era was moved to the Gulf region due to COVID-19-related restrictions in the original host nation, India. Pakistan captain Babar Azam and his deputy Mohammad Rizwan were in scintillating form in country’s first victory against India in an ICC World Cup in 13 attempts. It was also India’s first 10-wicket loss in the T20Is. Pakistan won all five Super 12 matches to progress to the semis, while New Zealand beat India to grab the fourth semifinal spot. The Kiwis one-upped England in the first semifinal thanks to Daryl Mitchell’s 47-ball 72. In the other semifinal, Rizwan had seemingly led Pakistan to a competitive score and Shadab Khan’s leg spin had Australia on the ropes but some poor fielding, combined with destructive hitting by Marcus Stoinis and Matthew Wade, took the Aussies through. Kane Williamson’s 48-ball 85 helped New Zealand set a target of 173 in the final, only for Glenn Maxwell and Mitchell Marsh to blow it away with seven balls to spare. Host: Australia
Final: England vs Pakistan
Winner: England – by five wickets
Teams: 16
Player of the tournament: Sam Curran Namibia beat Sri Lanka in the first group match to produce one of the tournament’s biggest shocks. The second one came the next day, when Scotland beat two-time champions West Indies who also lost to Ireland and were removed in the first round. Hosts and holders Australia were effectively washed out of the Super 12s by the weather. India did set things right by beating Pakistan in an epic chase, led by who else but Kohli, leaving the Pakistanis to scrape through to the semis by beating a gutsy Zimbabwe. Pakistan romped a seven-wicket win against New Zealand in the semifinal to draw comparisons with their triumphant run at the 1992 World Cup. The next logical step would be to meet England in the final, and the 2010 champions duly obliged by blowing away India. Returning prodigal son Alex Hales struck an unbeaten match-winning 56 in a 10-wicket victory. The 1992 comparisons remained on course as Pakistan set a middling target in front of a packed Melbourne Cricket Ground, before Haris Rauf gave them a good start with the ball. Stokes flipped the history books, however, to break Pakistani hearts and take England to their second T20 title.",2024,5

https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/4/28/bangladesh-reopens-schools-even-as-heatwave-alert-extended-by-three-days,4/28/2024,"Millions of students have returned to their schools across Bangladesh despite a heatwave that prompted a nationwide classroom shutdown last weekend. The reopening of schools on Sunday came as the authorities issued another heatwave alert for three more days as the South Asian country faces its longest heatwave in 75 years.     The heatwave reached a 29th day on Sunday, the longest since the government started keeping records in 1948, said meteorologist Shaheenul Islam. The season’s highest temperature at 42.7 degrees Celsius was recorded in the southwestern district of Chuadanga on Friday. Capital Dhaka’s maximum temperature was 38.2 degrees that day, according to the meteorological data. The average maximum temperatures in Dhaka over the past week have been 4-5 degrees Celsius (7.2-9 degrees Fahrenheit) higher than the 30-year average for the same period. Extensive scientific research has found climate change is causing heatwaves to become longer, more frequent and more intense. Classes resumed on Sunday with anxious relatives accompanying their children to school gates for the start of classes in Bangladesh, which follows the Sunday-Thursday Islamic work week. “I went to the school with my 13-year-old daughter. She was happy her school was open. But I was tense,” said Lucky Begum, whose daughter is enrolled at a state-run school in Dhaka. “The heat is too much,” she told the AFP news agency. “She already got heat rashes from sweating. I hope she does not get sick.” About 32 million students were kept at home by the school shutdown, Save the Children said in a statement this week. A directive from education authorities announcing the resumption of classes said preschools would remain shut while primary school hours would be shortened. Bangladesh’s weather bureau on Sunday said the heatwave would continue for at least three days. The previously record hot spell of 23 days was recorded in 2019, according to data tracked by Bangladesh’s meteorological department. Physician Mohammad Niatuzzaman, head of state-run Mughdah Hospital in Dhaka, said his hospital received a large number of patients suffering from heatstroke, dehydration, exhaustion and respiratory problems. Forecaster Kazi Jebunnesa said rain would likely bring some relief after Thursday. Another weather bureau meteorologist, Muhammad Abul Kalam Mallik, told AFP Bangladesh had not seen such an intense heatwave since records began in 1948. “It is a record as far as the duration and the coverage area in the country are concerned,” he said, adding that the searing temperatures were affecting about three-quarters of the country. Mallik said climate change and man-made causes, including rapid urbanisation, forest clearance, shrinking water bodies and increased air conditioning were to blame. “The trouble is, we will see more such severe heatwaves in the future,” he said.",2024,4

https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/3/26/conflict-climate-corruption-drive-southeast-asia-people-trafficking-un,3/26/2024,"Conflict, climate and the demand for low-paid labour in countries such as Thailand and Malaysia, with corruption as a “major enabler”, are driving the growth of the people smuggling trade in Southeast Asia, according to a new report from the United Nations Office for Drugs and Crime (UNODC). Tens of thousands of people from Myanmar as well as from other parts of Southeast Asia and from outside the region are smuggled to, through and from Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand every year, the UNODC said in its report Migrant Smuggling in Southeast Asia, which was published on Tuesday.     The report identified three key trends in people smuggling: the demand for workers willing to take on low-wage jobs and the limited channels available for people to fill these jobs legally; the existence of “substantial populations” of people in need of international protection but also with few legal ways to reach safety; and the prevalence of corruption among some public officials. The report noted that such corruption acted as a “driver and enabler of migrant smuggling, as well as contributing to impunity for perpetrators. Public officials share smuggling profits; are bribed to ensure compliance; and obstruct criminal investigations.” The UNODC surveyed some 4,785 migrants and refugees in Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand for the report, with 83 percent of them saying they were smuggled. An additional 60 migrants and refugees also took part in in-depth qualitative interviews, while 35 key informants were interviewed. One in four of those smuggled said they had experienced corruption and been forced to bribe officials including immigration officers, police and the military. The UNODC noted that corruption also fed the smuggling trade, because those making the journey felt they needed the smugglers to deal with state authorities, because of the corruption. Many of those fleeing conflict were from Myanmar, including the mostly Muslim Rohingya, hundreds of thousands of whom fled into neighbouring Bangladesh when the military began a brutal crackdown in 2017, which is now being investigated as genocide. The report comes amid a surge in the number of Rohingya people risking dangerous sea journeys from Bangladesh and Myanmar in the hope of reaching safety in Southeast Asia. On Monday, Indonesia ended the search for a boat thought to be carrying about 150 people that capsized off the coast of the northern province of Aceh, tossing dozens of people into the sea. Some 69 people were rescued and three bodies recovered. The UNODC also found that abuse was rife, with three-quarters of those surveyed saying they had experienced some form of abuse during their journey from the smugglers themselves, the military and police, or criminal gangs. Physical violence was the most reported type of abuse. In 2015, Thailand and Malaysia discovered mass graves at more than two dozen trafficking camps hidden in the jungle on the Malaysian side of the border at Wang Kelian. Police found 139 graves as well as signs that those held there had been tortured. Thailand and Malaysia carried out a joint investigation into the camps and Thailand convicted 62 defendants, including nine government officials, over the deaths and trafficking of Rohingya and Bangladeshis to Malaysia via Thailand two years later. Last June, Malaysia charged four Thai nationals over the camps after they were extradited from Bangkok. An earlier inquiry found that no Malaysian enforcement officials, public servants or local citizens were involved in trafficking syndicates, but there was “gross negligence” on the part of border patrols who had failed to notice the camps. As well as conflict and work, the UNODC said climate change had emerged as a factor in people smuggling to Southeast Asia. The report said one in four of those surveyed had said they felt compelled to migrate because of more extreme weather events including heat waves and flooding, including three out of four Bangladeshis surveyed. The report found the average price paid to be smuggled to Southeast Asia was $2,380 with men paying slightly more than women. Afghans being smuggled to Malaysia and Indonesia paid the most – $6,004.",2024,3
https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/3/21/rohingya-boat-capsizes-off-coast-of-indonesia-at-least-50-feared-dead,3/21/2024,"Medan, Indonesia – At least 69 Rohingya refugees have been rescued after a wooden boat with an estimated 150 people on board capsized off the coast of Indonesia’s Aceh province. The Commission for Missing Persons and Victims of Violence (KontraS Aceh) said on Thursday that 42 men, 18 women and nine children had been brought to port.     But dozens more are feared to have drowned after the boat ran into trouble some 19km (12 miles) from the beach of Kuala Bubon on the west coast of Aceh on Wednesday morning. Earlier, six people – four women and two men – were rescued from the boat by Acehnese fishermen and taken to a shelter, where they were able to speak to Faisal Rahman, a representative from the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR). Rahman said the survivors’ testimony suggested many had drowned. “We can’t confirm the exact number of casualties, but according to information from the six who were rescued, there are many dead,” he told Al Jazeera. “They assume about 50 people died when the boat capsized.” It is thought that most of those presumed to have died were unable to swim, and carried out to sea by the currents. Amateur footage shot by local fishermen at the scene, which has been widely shared on Indonesian social media, showed survivors standing on the boat’s upturned hull. They mostly appeared to be male. Emaciated and dressed in shorts, T-shirts and singlets they waved at the fishermen and begged to be rescued. Amiruddin, a fishing community leader in the Aceh Barat district where Kuala Bubon is located, said a search and rescue boat from Indonesia’s National Search and Rescue Agency had been dispatched on Wednesday. It is unclear why the boat sank, although wooden boats carrying refugees from the camps in Bangladesh are often in poor condition and overcrowded, with only basic facilities on board. In August 2023, 17 Rohingya refugees died when their boat sank in the Bay of Bengal. UNHCR’s Rahman said the rescue agency had been unable to find the exact location of the boat on Wednesday night. Azharul Husna, the coordinator of KontraS Aceh, questioned why a rescue boat needed to be sent from Banda Aceh, some 223km (138 miles) away from Kuala Bubon, when the rescue agency had other boats in the vicinity.

Some held banners calling for a “boycott” of the Rohingya, who are fleeing decades of persecution in their native Myanmar that exploded into a brutal military crackdown in western Rakhine state in 2017. Some one million Rohingya have been living in overcrowded camps in Bangladesh ever since, while the situation in Myanmar has deteriorated further since the February 2021 military coup, prompting many refugees to seek safety elsewhere. In recent years, however, people in Aceh have become increasingly resistant to the Rohingya who are usually trying to reach Malaysia, which had 108,500 registered Rohingya refugees at the end of February, according to the UNHCR. In December last year, the Indonesian navy pushed back a boat carrying Rohingya refugees as it approached the coast of Aceh, amid resentment among residents at a perceived sudden increase in boat arrivals. Also in December, a mob of students stormed the basement of a local community hall in Banda Aceh where about 137 Rohingya were taking shelter, and called for the group to be deported. Indonesia is not a signatory to the 1951 UN Convention on Refugees but was once considered to be more sympathetic to the Rohingya, compared with other countries in the region such as Malaysia or Thailand, where authorities have prevented boats from landing in previous years.    However, in recent years, this sympathy appears to have evaporated, with some Acehnese residents claiming, with little evidence, that the Rohingya receive more resources from aid agencies than residents and engage in criminal activity while in Indonesia. Similar claims have been made by some in Malaysia, also without evidence.",2024,3
https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/3/13/un-makes-appeal-calling-for-more-than-850-mn-for-rohingya-refugees,3/13/2024,"The United Nations is calling for more donations for Rohingya refugees living in camps in Bangladesh. In its annual response plan to the crisis, the UN appealed for $852.4m to provide food and other aid to the mostly Muslim Rohingya refugees and their host communities.     Bangladesh has taken in more than a million Rohingya, many of whom fled Myanmar after a brutal 2017 crackdown by the armed forces. Conflict there has escalated since the military seized power in a coup more than three years ago, and there has been fierce fighting in western Rakhine state where most of the country’s remaining Rohingya live in squalid camps. About 95 percent of the Rohingya people in Bangladesh remain dependent on humanitarian assistance, the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) said in a statement on Wednesday. “International solidarity with Bangladesh and refugee protection is needed more than ever as the conflict in Myanmar escalates,” it said. The UN made a similar appeal last year, asking countries to provide $876m to help the Rohingya, but only $440m was provided. With the humanitarian crisis largely out of the international spotlight, the UNHCR warned that significant funding shortfalls in recent years has had “serious implications”.    Many of the refugees are struggling to meet their basic needs, it warned, insisting that “sustained assistance is critically and urgently needed.” More than 75 percent of the refugees receiving aid are women and children, it said, adding that they are facing “heightened risks of abuse, exploitation and gender-based violence”. “More than half of the refugees in the camps are under 18, languishing amidst limited opportunities for education, skills-building and livelihoods,” the UNHCR said. The donations will be used to pay for food, shelter, healthcare, drinking water access, protection services, education and other assistance, the agency said. Many Rohingya wanting to escape conditions in the camps have attempted dangerous, often deadly boat journeys to Malaysia and Indonesia. Meanwhile, there is little progress towards repatriating the refugees to Myanmar, which is facing a UN genocide probe over the 2017 crackdown. The country has descended into what some have described as civil war since the 2021 coup removed the democratically-elected government of Nobel Peace Prize laureate Aung San Suu Kyi. “The human rights situation in Myanmar has morphed into a never-ending nightmare away from the spotlight of global politics,” UN rights chief Volker Turk told the UN Human Rights Council this month.

Bangladesh and Sri Lanka – not India and Pakistan – will play the first match of the series in Sylhet, Bangladesh on Monday, less than three months ahead of cricket’s showpiece event of the year.     Bangladesh captain Najmul Hossain Shanto said on Sunday that he wants his team to use the series to perfect the format ahead of the World Cup in June. The series marks the start of Sri Lanka’s month-long tour of Bangladesh, which also includes three one-day internationals and two Tests. Shanto said it was critical to “play as a team”, noting that they bagged big wins last year when “everyone contributed”. Bangladesh defeated world champions England 3-0 at home in 2023, and also won series against Ireland and Afghanistan, before drawing a three-match series 1-1 against New Zealand. Shanto said he wanted to keep the momentum going into the World Cup, hosted this year by the United States and the West Indies. “Last year, we did well in T20s,” he told reporters. “It is very important that we play eight or 11 matches before going to the World Cup. “If we take these matches… and decide how we want to play in the World Cup, then it will be easy to plan.” The World Cup is a key focus of Sri Lanka, too. Sri Lanka coach Chris Silverwood said he was expecting a “very competitive series between two good sides”. “Obviously, we’re now in the build-up to what is an important competition in the World Cup,” he said. “What we have to do … is concentrate on what’s in front of us and remember what we’re aiming for.” Trophy Unveiling 🏆 | T20i Series

Venomous on-field celebrations – which started with the “nagin dance” in 2018 – are almost a permanent fixture as well. The last time both teams met was in the 50-over World Cup, when Bangladesh won by three wickets, but not without controversial scenes on the ground. Sri Lanka’s Angelo Mathews became the first cricketer to be dismissed “timed out” in an international match as he failed to take guard and declare himself ready to face the bowler within the stipulated time of two minutes since the dismissal of the last batter. Bangladesh captain Shakib Al Hasan appealed for a “timed out” dismissal, which was upheld by the on-field umpire. Bangladesh and Sri Lanka are both in Group D for the World Cup, along with South Africa, Nepal and the Netherlands. The second and third T20 matches will be held on March 6 and 9, both also at Sylhet. Sri Lanka, who arrived in Bangladesh on Thursday, will also play three one-day internationals and two Tests during the month-long tour. Bangladesh have never defeated Sri Lanka in a Twenty20 series. Both teams have met on 13 occasions and Sri Lanka hold the upper hand with nine wins compared to Bangladesh’s three.

https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2024/2/14/exploited-abused-trapped-the-lives-of-italys-south-asian-rose-sellers,2/14/2024,"Names marked with an asterisk have been changed to protect identities.  After a night of selling roses in Tuscany, Mohammed* was cycling along a seaside road when someone in a passing car hit him on the back with a pole.     He fell to the ground. It was August 2013 and Mohammed was 22. He believes it was intentional and likely a racist attack. “I was already broken,” he said. “But after that, I was in pieces.” He suffered emotionally and still has back pain from the assault today. He had arrived in Italy a few months earlier following a harrowing seven-month journey via land and sea. He had no documents or money and owed 9,000 euros ($9,700) to the Bangladeshi agents who had arranged his trip. Mohammed says he was guided by multiple people along the way. When he arrived in Tuscany, he was approached by men from his country who, he says, put him to work selling roses in busy city centres so he could pay for room and board at a house with nine other foreign workers. “I didn’t like bothering people while they were eating to ask them if they wanted to buy a rose from me,” said Mohammed. “But I had no choice.” Rose sellers are a common sight in Italy’s largest and most romantic cities, such as Rome, Milan or Turin. South Asian men wield bunches of red roses and approach hordes of tourists every night. During high season, you may see about 20 rose sellers a night spread across the city centre – and dozens more on Valentine’s Day weekend. But hidden behind the universal symbol of love is a bleak story of hardship, labour exploitation and human trafficking. On a given night, rose sellers of all ages can walk miles on end, weathering rejection, police scrutiny and even violence to sell a few flowers. “They are a pain in the ass,” said a Welsh tourist on a February night, at the top of the Spanish steps in Rome. Despite their familiar presence and the dangers they encounter, there are almost no official records or data about these street vendors. In recent years, several attacks on rose sellers in various parts of the country have been reported in local news outlets; they are often carried out by young Italian men. In November, a 50-year-old Bangladeshi rose seller described as a “well-known face” in Ivrea, Turin, was brutally beaten by a group of three men. Another Bangladeshi seller was randomly pushed into the Naviglio canal in Milan by two men in 2020. A year earlier, two young men in Nettuno reportedly beat and robbed a seller whose origin was unknown. It is unclear what consequences – if any – the perpetrators ultimately faced in each case. “They are visible to everybody but there is no data. There is nothing,” said Marina Mazzini, who conducted one of the only case studies on rose vendors in Italy for the United Nations Interregional Crime and Justice Research Institute (UNICRI). For this article, as well as Mohammed, Al Jazeera interviewed two other rose sellers, three former vendors and four NGOs who have supported dozens of rose vendors with their documentation. South Asians who end up selling roses in Italy are predominantly from Bangladesh. Nearly all have crippling debts and rely on members of their communities to help them start life in a new country. Mohammed says he was hosted in Tuscany by a man of Bangladeshi origin and another from Pakistan. On the first day Mohammed was to sell roses, his hosts gave him 30 euros ($32) and told him to go to a local flower vendor to buy them. The hosts were always in contact with the flower shops to track how many roses each seller bought, Mohammed said. He says he spent at least 12 hours a night traversing the city’s restaurants, bars, monuments and other tourist hot spots until all the flowers were sold before returning to his hosts’ home, where he would sleep with five others in the same room. There is no going rate for a red rose. Vendors may ask for a few euros and accept between two and five ($2.16 to $5.40) depending on each sale. If he made 120 euros ($129) from selling 200 roses on a good night, he would have to give 60 euros ($65) to the flower seller and 50 euros ($54) back to his hosts for room, board and the promise of a good lawyer to get his paperwork in order, Mohammed said. The 10 euros ($11) left were usually spent on cigarettes and a coffee. Soon, he had trouble sleeping, and started suffering from panic attacks and nightmares about his journey – part of which he says was spent on a ship with 200 other people making their way from Egypt to Sicily. If local police poked around when he was working, Mohammed was transferred to a different area. In between selling flowers, he worked at a Bangladeshi grocery store in Genova, where he says his work was never compensated, sold artichokes at a Milan market and sold roses again in southern Italy, while toiling intermittently as a gardener, dishwasher and chef’s assistant. After about seven years, Mohammed was granted asylum in 2018 as a victim of human trafficking with the help of a local NGO, Comunità Progetto Sud. Mohammed believes his countrymen let him down. “A Moroccan helped me to learn Italian and Italians helped me get documents,” Mohammed said. “I have only been exploited by my own people.” “To the young people who are now coming to Italy, I tell them not to trust their own people,” he added. Uddin Md Mofiz, 55, who arrived in Rome in 1987, said he was among the first rose sellers in the country. He described his early years in Italy as “very hard”. “I slept in trains, I slept in cars, I slept at the Termini train station in Rome. At the beginning … all my money went to food and rent,” Mofiz said. Siddique Nure Alam, the president of a Bangladeshi association in Rome called Dhuumcatu, said he worked with Mofiz and others as a rose vendor 35 years ago. Alam said every street seller who arrived in Italy was already indebted. But Mofiz and Alam do not view their early hardship as exploitative. “If I have good arms and legs, I can work. Nothing happens instantly. Things take time. Slowly, slowly, you have to build your life,” Mofiz said. According to experts, it is difficult to track exploitation among South Asian street vendors because they often do not consider themselves exploited. They rarely seek help, viewing their suffering as a necessary step towards a better future. “When a Bangladeshi describes his exploitation, he doesn’t call it as such, but instead blames his difficulties on the high cost of living,” said Luca Scopetti, the coordinator of the anti-trafficking section of Parsec, a social cooperative in Rome. For people under pressure to repay debts and compensate their hosts, “informal work is the only means of survival”, UNICRI’s Mazzini said. Alessandro Arrighetti, a professor of economics of productive sectors at the University of Parma, said selling roses is a dead-end pursuit. “The experience you get [from selling roses] does not increase professional skills,” he said. Rose sellers struggle to learn Italian or move onto a better job, remaining stranded. “You can stay there for a year, two or even 10 years.” While Italian authorities have the expertise and means to identify typical victims of human trafficking – such as foreign women forced into prostitution – those at the sharp end of labour exploitation are less visible, according to Francesca Nicodemi, a lawyer specialised in trafficking. “The numbers of female victims of trafficking recognised as refugees are higher than that of men trafficked for labour exploitation,” Nicodemi said. As things stand, undocumented workers like Mohammed can only be provided with assistance if they themselves identify as victims of trafficking to Italian authorities, Nicodemi said. The case will then be examined to determine whether there is a “well-founded fear of persecution” – according to the 1951 Geneva Convention on the status of refugees. “Mainly, these persons are recognised as ‘economic migrants’ or at least victims of smuggling because they have chosen to arrive in Italy voluntarily,” Nicodemi said. Even if a rose seller were to lodge a complaint with police, officials may “lack the expertise” to recognise this type of exploitation, said Carla Quinto, the head of legal at the Be Free anti-trafficking cooperative in Rome. “[This] prevents the person who reports from being recognised as a victim of trafficking for the purpose of labour exploitation,” said Quinto. In any case, some rose sellers likely believe making 10 euros ($11) a day is better than making nothing, she added. To effectively help them, exploited migrants must be able to work and have a place to live. NGOs like Liotti’s and Scopetti’s reach out to undocumented workers to help them recognise their own exploitation and seek asylum. “Migrants don’t just take but also offer and share their culture,” Mohammed said. “When they arrive, let’s properly identify them and give them opportunities. Let’s see what they bring and what we can offer them because migrants do not bring with them the bad.” Mohammed eventually beat his fear and depression. Today, he is fluent in Italian and works as a beekeeper, caring for 300 hives. This article was developed with the support of Journalismfund Europe",2024,2

Last week, a supplier for the Indian consumer goods giant Marico faced a chilly reception in Dhaka’s Panthapath area. Grocery shops, usually eager to stock their shelves with its hair oil, cooking oil, body lotion and other products, refused to take new deliveries.     “Sales of Parachute oil, a Marico bestseller, have plummeted to almost zero in recent weeks,” local shopkeeper Aman Ullah said. “Indian products just aren’t moving. We’re stuck with unsold stock and won’t be restocking.” Another shop owner who requested anonymity revealed a deeper reason: “I don’t want to sell Indian products any more.” He cited YouTube videos advocating a boycott of Indian goods, which he wholeheartedly supported. Simmering anti-India sentiment in Bangladesh has boiled over in the past decade, culminating in public displays such as celebrations in Dhaka last year after India’s loss in the Cricket World Cup final. But after last month’s elections in Bangladesh, in which Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina secured a fourth term while the opposition boycotted the polls, a massive “India Out” campaign was launched, alleging Indian interference in Bangladesh politics. The Bangladeshi diaspora and opposition groups have fuelled this anti-India movement and advocated boycotts of Indian products. This movement mirrors similar campaigns in the Maldives, where Mohamed Muizzu capitalized on anti-India sentiment to win the presidential election. In Dhaka, the campaign was launched against the backdrop of India’s traditionally strong ties with Hasina’s government and its strained relationship with the opposition, leading many to believe India favoured the status quo. Exiled Bangladeshi physician Pinaki Bhattacharya, who fled alleged government harassment in 2018, has emerged as the key figure in this burgeoning social media movement accusing India of interfering in Bangladesh’s recent elections to keep Hasina in power. Through his more than two million followers across social media platforms, Bhattacharya launched the #BoycottIndia campaign in mid-January, urging them to join “this monumental endeavour”. His call, emphasizing love of homeland and determination to break free from perceived shackles, resonated with thousands. The anti-India movement has surged online, fuelled by user-generated content. Photos of crossed-out Indian products like Amul butter and Dabur honey are circulating alongside barcode identification tips to boycott these goods. A single post highlighting the 890 prefix used in barcodes for Indian products garnered more than 1,000 shares, showcasing the movement’s online reach. The Indian High Commission in Dhaka declined Al Jazeera’s request for a comment on this anti-India campaign. At a Mumbai forum on January 30 with Indian External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar, attendees raised concerns about India’s foreign policy amid perceived shifts in regional dynamics, particularly the growing pull of major rival China on neighbouring countries like Bangladesh and the Maldives. Jaishankar downplayed concerns about foreign policy shortcomings but conceded the competitive reality. He pointed out that China’s geographical proximity naturally grants it influence over neighbouring countries like the Maldives, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh.   State Minister of Information and Broadcasting and lawmaker from the ruling Awami League Mohammad A Arafat, too, dismissed the concerns saying Bangladesh had received global attention because of the unprecedented fact of a fourth term for the ruling government. “If I have to talk about other country’s interest in our local politics, then the first name I would mention is the United States which even declared a Visa restriction policy based on Bangladesh election. On the other hand, India, from the very onset officially stated that Bangladesh’s election is its internal matter and it has no say in it,” Arafat said. Obaidul Quader, general secretary of Awami League told Al Jazeera that the “India out” campaign is run by opposition parties who instead of taking part in the election blaming “India for their misfortune.” “They [the opposition parties] have this trump card of bashing India if anything goes against them,” said Quader, “I don’t think common people of Bangladesh support this campaign. They know that Awami League will never work against the interest of people.” The burgeoning anti-India campaign, meanwhile, is finding traction within Bangladesh’s domestic political landscape, raising concerns about potentially destabilising Bangladesh’s economy and impacting regional relations. Gono Odhikar Parishad, a rising political force aligned with the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP)-led opposition, is promoting the boycott movement. Party leader Nurul Haque Nur declared at a recent rally in Dhaka that “We all have to start an ‘India Out’ campaign'” while alleging Indian interference in the recent elections. Rumeen Farhana, international affairs secretary of the BNP, told Al Jazeera that the people of Bangladesh never liked India’s interference in Bangladesh politics. “It’s now crystal clear that India did everything possible to keep the regime in power since 2014,” she alleged. Resentment against India reached a boiling point in Bangladesh after Hasina’s Awami League secured a resounding victory in the January 7 elections, capturing 223 seats out of 300 in parliament. Critics alleged the process lacked legitimacy due to the opposition’s boycott and the presence of numerous Awami League-backed independent candidates, raising questions about the fairness of the vote. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi offered swift congratulations to both Hasina and “the people of Bangladesh for the successful conduct of elections”, endorsing the outcome. In contrast, Western governments expressed reservations, highlighting the boycott and the lack of a strong opposition presence. Farhana said anti-India public sentiment in Bangladesh goes beyond politics. “The border killing, unresolved water sharing of 53 rivers including Teesta, trade deficit all play roles to that,” she said. Around 1,276 Bangladeshis have been killed and 1,183 injured by India’s border forces since 2010, according to human rights organisation Odhikar. Then there are the decades-old unresolved water-sharing agreements for 53 transboundary rivers in addition to Bangladesh’s massive trade deficit with India, all of which have raised concerns about Bangladesh’s sovereignty and economic independence. Ali Riaz, distinguished professor of politics and government at Illinois State University, told Al Jazeera that India’s unqualified support of the Awami League and Hasina during the 2024 elections has raised questions among many citizens about “whether it has compromised the country’s sovereignty”. However, Sreeradha Datta, a professor at the Jindal School of International Affairs in Sonepat, India, refuted the claims of India’s “unqualified support” and said the Awami League was “creative in going past the polls even if India [had] not agree[d] to recognise the election”. “China and so many others congratulated PM Hasina right after the election, so would that make any difference if India didn’t support it?” she asked. Analysts, meanwhile, pointed out that boycotting Indian goods could have major repercussions for the economic relationship between the two countries. India is a major exporter to Bangladesh with annual trade historically exceeding $12bn. Additionally, Bangladesh relies heavily on India for essential commodities, and the two governments are currently in talks on an annual quota of imports of Indian farm products. Calling the anti-India campaign a “political stunt”, Munshi Faiz Ahmed, former chairman of the Bangladesh Institute of International and Strategic Studies, a state-funded think tank, told Al Jazeera that the economic fallout of boycotting Indian products will be more severe for Bangladesh. “I don’t think any rational Bangladeshi would opt for taking part in this campaign. India is our neighbouring country, and we are heavily dependent on them for our everyday essentials like rice and onions. We are dependent because we get those products at the cheapest prices because of geographical proximity,” Ahmed said, adding that sourcing those products from somewhere else would cost much more. Jyoti Rahman, an Australia-based economist told Al Jazeera that the “India Out” movement may be politically important to the extent that “it sends a strong message to the Indian policymakers” about growing discontent in Bangladesh but the “economic effects are less clear cut”. Rahman pointed out that despite being India’s fourth largest export destination, Bangladesh still comprises about 3.5 percent of the Indian export market. “Even if all exports to Bangladesh stopped, it probably wouldn’t significantly affect the Indian economy as these products would find a market elsewhere,” Rahman said. On the other hand, he said, a fifth of Bangladeshi imports are from India, including essentials such as cotton for the garment manufacturing sector, cereals and produce such as onions. “[Looking at] other sources of imports for these products could stoke inflation further,” Rahman said. However, he highlighted the potential political effectiveness of boycotting non-essential items like tourism, cultural imports like Bollywood movies and consumer products, which he said could benefit domestic industries. The overwhelming dependence of Bangladesh on India also means that “Indian businesses are vulnerable if such a movement gains traction and support”, Riaz said. Even if the economic impacts are limited or not immediate, the boycotts will contribute to the public discourse on the role of India in Bangladeshi politics and highlight the unequal relationship, he said. “This is no less important.” Additional reporting by Abu Jakir",2024,2
https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/24/unhcr-569-rohingya-died-at-sea-in-2023-highest-in-nine-years,1/24/2024,"Some 569 Rohingya people died or went missing at sea last year – the most since 2014 – as they embarked on dangerous boat journeys to Southeast Asia, according to the United Nations refugee agency. The UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) said nearly 4,500 Rohingya people took boats across the Andaman Sea and Bay of Bengal in 2023, fleeing crowded refugee camps in Bangladesh or persecution in their native Myanmar. “Estimates show one Rohingya was reported to have died or gone missing for every eight people attempting the journey in 2023,” UNHCR spokesperson Matthew Saltmarsh said in a statement. “This makes the Andaman Sea and Bay of Bengal one of the deadliest stretches of water in the world.” Hundreds of thousands of Rohingya live in crowded refugee camps in Bangladesh after a brutal crackdown by the Myanmar military in 2017 that is the subject of a genocide case at the International Court of Justice (ICJ).     Those who remain in Myanmar, where the military seized power in a coup nearly three years ago, are mainly confined to camps in their native Rakhine State with strict curbs on their movement and daily lives. More than 1,500 Rohingya landed on the northern tip of Indonesia’s Sumatra island on barely seaworthy wooden boats in November and December last year, a period when waters are generally calmer. But while people there have previously welcomed the refugees, this time villagers and the military pushed boats back out to sea and told their passengers they could not come ashore despite the dreadful conditions on board. In one incident, some 200 people were feared to have drowned after their boat sank in the Andaman Sea. Others remained at sea for days longer as they sought a place to land. In December, a mob of students stormed a community hall in Banda Aceh where dozens of Rohingya had been given shelter, demanding that the group be deported. The UNHCR urged governments to take steps to avoid a repeat of such tragedies. “Saving lives and rescuing those in distress at sea is a humanitarian imperative and a longstanding duty under international maritime law,” the statement said, adding that the UNHCR was working to develop a “comprehensive regional response” to the boat journeys. Many of the Rohingya who flee Bangladesh and Myanmar hope to make it to Malaysia, a majority-Muslim country that is currently home to nearly 108,000 Rohingya refugees. Like Indonesia, Malaysia is not a signatory to the UN Convention on Refugees, and those who live in the country are considered undocumented migrants at risk of harassment, detention or deportation.",2024,1
https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/10/as-west-condemns-bangladesh-election-china-and-russia-embrace-dhaka,1/10/2024,"Dhaka, Bangladesh — Hours after Bangladesh’s ruling Awami League was declared the landslide winner in Sunday’s election, which the opposition had boycotted, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina hosted a queue of foreign diplomats, each coming to congratulate her. The envoys of India, the Philippines, Singapore and other nations were there. Also visiting the prime minister were the ambassadors of Russia and China.     In Washington and London, meanwhile, the governments of the United Kingdom and the United States criticised the election as illegitimate. US State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller, in a statement, said that Washington believed the voting process was “not free and fair, and we regret that not all parties participated”. The UK criticised what it described as “acts of intimidation and violence” during the election. Bangladesh’s response? “We’re not bothered,” foreign minister AK Abdul Momen said on Tuesday, when asked about the comments from the US and the UK. That contrast between the West’s condemnation and the welcoming embrace of China and Russia is a window into potentially dramatic foreign policy consequences of Hasina’s return to power, say political analysts and economists. For the West, Hasina’s increasing ties with China and Russia, on top of Bangladesh’s rejection of its concerns over the election, could poison ties with Dhaka. But that in turn could end up pushing Dhaka even closer to Beijing and Moscow. Dhaka-based political analyst Zahed Ur Rahman said he believes there is a likelihood of the US imposing visa restrictions and targeted sanctions against individuals who played key roles in the conduct of the election, which independent monitors have criticised for violence and intimidation against the ruling party’s political opponents. In August, the US had declared a first set of constraints on visas for some Bangladeshi officials. But doing so, he said, could jeopardise US plans to rope Bangladesh into its strategy to balance the rise of China, especially with the deepening economic ties between Dhaka and Beijing. China has been Bangladesh’s top trading partner for more than a decade – a period during which Hasina has ruled uninterrupted. “The new government will find it very challenging to work deeply with the US’s Indo-Pacific strategy that actually is a policy to contain China,” Rahman said. Russia, meanwhile, has supported Bangladesh in opening the country’s first nuclear power plant. Dhaka received the first supply of uranium from Moscow in October. Russia is also a major supplier of three essential commodities  – fuel, food grains and fertilisers – to Bangladesh at relatively affordable prices. “If the West led by the US goes very coercive with the new government, then Bangladesh ties with Russia will grow fast,” Rahman said. That geopolitical calculus poses challenges for the West, said experts. It will be difficult for the US and its allies to go about business as usual with Bangladesh. But it is unclear how far they might go in trying to hurt Hasina’s government. The West “will face a serious dilemma,” said Ali Riaz, professor and political scientist at Illinois State University. Yet, Bangladesh, too, faces tough choices. The country’s apparel industry, which employs four million workers, clocked exports worth $47bn in 2023 – 84 percent of the country’s total exports. The US is the single largest export destination for Bangladeshi garments. However, recently, eight US Congress members wrote to the American Apparel and Footwear Association to pressure Dhaka on fair wages and labour rights in Bangladesh. Several workers have been killed in clashes with security forces during street protests seeking a raise in minimum wages. Bangladesh’s embassy in Washington has cautioned its government in Dhaka that the country’s ready-made garments sector could become a target of Western measures. It’s a concern that economist Mustafizur Rahman shares. “If the US and the EU take any punitive measure in the form of additional tariff or sanctions, then there will of course be an adverse impact,” Rahman, a distinguished fellow at the Dhaka-based Centre for Policy Dialogue, told Al Jazeera. Bangladesh’s dependence on garment exports makes it particularly vulnerable to any such targeting, he said. And any resulting economic turmoil would only push Bangladesh even further towards China. “It is not because the Western countries may either put more pressure or recalibrate its policy, but because the ongoing economic crisis will require deep-pocket support and there will be increasing ideological affinity between these two countries’ leadership,” said Riaz at Illinois State University. In Dhaka, Awami League spokesperson Mahbubul Alam Hanif insisted that Sunday’s election would not affect the government’s relations with the West. “We have development partners and they often give suggestions, including to strengthen democracy, but I don’t think Sunday’s election affects US-Bangladesh ties,” Hanif said. How the re-elected Awami League government handles politics post-election could also determine the pressure on the US and its allies to act against Bangladesh. Since mid-August last year, more than 27,200 members of the main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party have been imprisoned and at least 104,000 have been sued on different charges, according to BNP figures. At least 27 BNP men also have been killed in political violence since October. With a supermajority in parliament – the Awami League won 222 of 300 seats, and many of the more than 60 independents who won are former members of the ruling party who were allegedly asked to contest to give a veneer of a fight – opposition leaders expect the government to target them even more. BNP leader Kayser Kamal said the “illegitimate” government would intensify its crackdown on opponents to divert attention from the “sham” election. Riaz agreed. “Bangladesh is becoming a de facto one-party state,” he said. The government, he said, would “adopt more repressive measures, try to decimate any kind of opposition through legal and extra-legal measures”.",2024,1
https://www.aljazeera.com/podcasts/2024/1/9/the-take-how-sheikh-hasinas-journey-to-power-transformed-bangladesh,1/9/2024," Sheikh Hasina has won a fourth straight term as Bangladesh’s prime minister. The daughter of the country’s founding father earned her own reputation as a pro-democracy leader. But in recent years she has been accused of cracking down on critics, with the opposition boycotting this year’s elections and calling them a sham.

https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2024/1/9/hasina-remains-the-high-priestess-of-bangladeshs-dynastic-democracy,1/9/2024,"It has been said that for the past 15 years, Bangladesh’s elections have been so skewed in favour of the ruling Awami League, they are enough to make North Korea’s Kim Jong Un squirm with envy. An unfair comparison perhaps, but Sunday’s results, where the party, led by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, secured 222 seats out of 300, are enough to make even the most unbiased among us raise a sceptical eyebrow. But should we really be surprised by what was a foregone conclusion? And what does the result mean for the future of Bangladesh? Given that the election was uncontested by the country’s main opposition, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), amid concerns that it would be rigged, and with large swaths of the 120 million eligible voters abstaining, it is hardly unexpected that the Awami League swept the board. Officials say some 40 percent of voters went to the polls, but media reports and analysts suggest the real figure is likely not more than 30 percent. Either way, it is clear that the people of Bangladesh voted with their feet.     A look back at the 2018 elections reminds us that the BNP’s concerns were not unfounded. At the time, Human Rights Watch and other groups called for an independent investigation following allegations of voter intimidation, vote rigging and partisan behaviour by election officials. Added to this, a UK broadcaster filmed a filled ballot box being taken away from a polling station before it had even opened. Little wonder, then, that the BNP feared the same would happen again. More recently, on October 28, the massive antigovernment protest that turned violent signalled a resounding and systematic crackdown on dissent ahead of the elections. On that day, hundreds of thousands of opposition supporters demanded Hasina step down and the installation of a neutral caretaker government. Tens of thousands of protesters, including senior leaders, were arrested and thrown into jail following speedy trials. They included those who had not even been involved in the protests, but instead had cases against them dating back more than a decade. Authorities claim they were cracking down on violence but human rights groups defined what happened as “a violent autocratic crackdown ahead of the election”. The government denies Sunday’s election was uncontested despite the BNP’s boycott, saying 27 parties took part, as well as independent candidates, and that more than 100 independent election observers were present. But this, though technically true, does not allay concerns. Many of Sunday’s so-called “independents” are Awami League supporters. Bangladeshi media also reported that the party deliberately did not field any candidates in several constituencies, instead making space for its ally, the Jatiya Party. The road to a one-party state has been a steady one, with Sheikh Hasina – the world’s longest-serving female prime minister – being placed at the helm of the country for a fourth consecutive term and, for all intents and purposes, unchallenged. Ironic for the daughter of the country’s founding father, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, who, along with her bitter rival, former BNP leader Khaleda Zia, fought so hard for years for multiparty democracy and an end to military rule. That does not downplay the BNP’s own history of oppression and attacks on democracy. During its two-term rule (1991-96 and 2001-06), it was confronted with many of the accusations currently faced by the Awami League: corruption, human rights abuses, suppression of opposition groups and more. What is more, the party is tarnished with a history of being borne out of a military dictatorship: it was founded by Zia’s late husband, Ziaur Rahman, an army chief of staff who was president of Bangladesh from 1977 until his assassination in 1981. The BNP has in the past also joined forces with Jamaat-e-Islami – a conservative party that did not support Bangladesh’s independence in 1971 and has never made much headway in the ballot box. The BNP’s current acting chairman, Tarique Rahman, is a convicted criminal – albeit on charges his party says are politically motived – and living in exile in London. It is a track record that does not bode well for a party desperate to regain power. Yet the October protests revealed that the party still has widespread support, and in a country where there is growing discontent over the government’s handling of the economic downturn, it is quite possible that the BNP would have had a decent chance of winning, had the election been genuinely competitive. As things stand, Hasina remains the high priestess of Bangladesh’s distinct style of dynastic democracy. With a resounding majority in parliament for yet another term, her party can continue to push through any legislation it sees fit, with little by way of checks and balances. And with any resistance silenced, at least for now, the ground is fertile for more of the kind of human rights abuses the country already stands accused of. Even if the opposition continues to mobilise itself post-election, Hasina’s security forces are likely to continue their crackdown and see to it that dissenting voices pay a heavy price. If there is any pressure from outside Bangladesh, it is most likely to come from the United States. Before the election, Washington ramped up its political muscle-flexing with several recent visits to Dhaka by senior officials and by imposing visa bans on individuals it describes as “undermining the democratic process”. There was also the threat of sanctions. The US and the European Union are the largest importers of Bangladesh’s readymade garments – an industry worth $45bn. Pierre Prakash, director of the International Crisis Group’s Asia Programme, told me that any restrictions on the sector could inflict further pain on a population already reeling from rising food and fuel prices. “It is going to be tricky to come up with sanctions that are effective and at the same don’t hurt millions of people,” he explained. “The vast majority of workers employed by the garment industry are women, so sanctions could also work against women’s empowerment.” It’s not surprising, then, that US has already issued a post-election statement stating that it does not believe the elections were free and fair, but that it “notes” that the Awami League won. It feels like a volte-face. It knows that if it imposes sanctions, not only could it end up punishing common Bangladeshis, but it also risks a dent in its coffers. Buying from other sources may increase its costs marginally, but it is an additional cost the US can do without at a time when the country has spent billions of dollars on military aid to Ukraine and Israel, and Americans across the country are feeling the pinch of a cost-of-living crisis. For Bangladesh’s neighbours and allies, the election is less of a concern. As a one-party state, China is hardly the standard-bearer for democracy. And India, where there are growing signs of democratic backsliding and rising autocracy, is also not in a position to start finger-pointing. The denouncements of this year’s stage-managed election echo those of 2014 and 2018. Back then, little action was taken, and once the dust had settled, Hasina was welcomed into the international fold. Admittedly, it was an era when she had the support of many of her countryfolk and was credited for turning Bangladesh into one of the fastest-growing economies in the region, combating terrorism and providing shelter for more than a million Rohingya refugees. Now, though, times have changed. Hasina’s popularity has waned, largely due to the financial hardships her people are facing, but also because little doubt is left that she has instrumentalised the state machinery to cling on to power. Despite this, it seems that the worst Hasina can expect are limited sanctions by the US. If that happens – and it is still an “if” – the country’s beleaguered economy will undoubtedly be dented further. But with Chinese and Indian footprints firmly inside its territory, Western pressure is likely to have less of an impact on Bangladesh than it has in the past. There’s no denying, however, that while it may well be business as usual for Sheikh Hasina for the next five years, it will be so without a mandate from her people.

https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/8/bangladesh-pm-says-vote-victory-of-people-opposition-to-continue-protest,1/8/2024,"Dhaka, Bangladesh – Bangladesh’s Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina says her fifth term in power is a “victory of the people”, dismissing the opposition’s allegation that the vote was a “sham”. “I have been fighting throughout my life to ensure people’s democratic rights,” the 76-year-old leader said while addressing a news conference at her residence in capital Dhaka on Monday.     Without naming the main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), which boycotted Sunday’s polls, Hasina said, “They didn’t come to the election as they feared people’s judgement”, adding that the absence of one party did not mean “democracy is absent” in Bangladesh. The 12th parliamentary elections in the South Asian country saw an official voter turnout of about 40 percent, its third lowest ever. The BNP and some independent observers, however, questioned the veracity of that figure.    BNP leader Abdul Moyeen Khan called it a “fake election” and said the Awami League-led government was “illegitimate”, demanding the vote be cancelled. During a press briefing at the party office on Monday, Khan demanded a new election under a neutral caretaker administration to form “a credible and responsible government”. “A government of the dummy, by the dummy, for the dummy will be established if Hasina attempts to form any kind of government through this dummy election,” he said. Khan said the BNP will continue its protest to “restore people’s democratic rights” amid a months-old crackdown by the government. “We have a responsibility towards the people. We can’t let our country turn into a complete authoritarian state,” he said.    The Jatiya Party, which is now the main opposition group in parliament, also disputed the poll turnout and said the vote took place only to re-elect Hasina and her party members, “not to count people’s votes”. The party bagged 11 out of 300 parliamentary seats, while the governing party won 222. The independents won 61. Hasina herself won 249,962 votes from her constituency Gopalganj, about 165km (100 miles) south of Dhaka, while her nearest rival secured just 469 votes, local media reports said. Jatiya Party leader GM Quader said the election was fair only in the constituencies the Awami League wanted it to be fair. “But in other places, they just declared the numbers and names of the winning candidate. It was all pre-set,” he said. Envoys from several nations, including India, Russia, and China, congratulated Hasina on securing a record-extending fourth consecutive term. The United States, which had warned of a visa ban on Bangladesh’s government officials if the vote was unfair, has not issued any statement yet. The European Union and other Western governments had also put pressure on Hasina to ensure a free vote. Dhaka-based political analyst Zahed Ur Rahman told Al Jazeera Bangladesh has experienced a “severe blow to its core and structure” during Hasina’s 15-year tenure as premier. “There is hardly any separation of power that exists in this country now,” said Rahman, adding that the executive, the legislature and the judiciary are all essentially under the direct control of the prime minister’s office. “All other constitutional or statutory institutes in this country – like the Election Commission – have become mere extensions of the regime,” he added. Asif Nazrul, professor of law at Dhaka University, told Al Jazeera Bangladesh is already “an authoritarian state” in all the senses of the term. “All important institutions have been compromised to keep Hasina in power, and the way that has been done indicates the country’s transformation towards an authoritarian state,” he said.",2024,1
https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/8/sheikh-hasina-once-bangladeshs-democracy-icon-now-its-authoritarian-pm,1/8/2024,"Bangladesh’s Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina once joined her rivals in a fight to restore democracy but her long reign in power has been marked by arrests of opposition leaders, crackdowns on free speech and suppression of dissent. Hasina, 76, won a fourth straight term and fifth overall in power by sweeping Sunday’s general election, which was boycotted by the main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) for the second time in the last three polls.     Hasina branded the main opposition party a “terrorist organisation”. The daughter of the country’s founding father Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, who led Bangladesh’s independence from Pakistan, Hasina was fortunate to have been visiting Europe when most of her family members were assassinated in a military coup in 1975. Born in 1947 in southwestern Bangladesh, then East Pakistan, Hasina was the eldest of five children. She graduated with a degree in Bengali literature from Dhaka University in 1973 and gained political experience as a go-between for her father and his student followers. She returned to Bangladesh from India, where she lived in exile, in 1981 and later joined hands with political foe, BNP chief and former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia, to lead a popular uprising for democracy that toppled military ruler Hossain Mohammad Ershad from power in 1990. But the alliance with Zia did not last long and the bitter and deep-rooted rivalry between the two women, often called the “battling begums”, went on to dominate Bangladeshi politics for decades. Hasina first served a term as prime minister in 1996 but lost to Zia five years later. The pair were then imprisoned on corruption charges in 2007 after a coup by a military-backed government. The charges were dropped and they were free to contest an election the following year. Hasina won in a landslide and has been in power ever since. As time went on, she became increasingly autocratic and her rule has been marked by mass arrests of political opponents and activists, forced disappearances and extrajudicial killings. The 78-year-old Zia meanwhile is in ailing health and confined to hospital after corruption charges saw her sentenced to a 17-year prison term in 2018. Top BNP leaders have been sent behind bars while Zia’s eldest son and heir apparent Tarique Rahman is in exile in Britain. Rights groups have warned of a virtual one-party rule by Hasina’s Awami League.    Hasina refused BNP demands to resign and allow a neutral authority to run the election, accusing the opposition of instigating antigovernment protests that have rocked Dhaka since late October and killed at least 14 people. Both Hasina and her rivals have accused their opponents of trying to create chaos and violence to thwart political peace and jeopardise the democracy that has yet to take firm root in the South Asian country of 170 million people. Hasina said she did not need to prove the credibility of the election to anyone. “What is important is if the people of Bangladesh will accept this election.” Asif Nazrul, professor of law at Dhaka University, told Al Jazeera Hasina is a “shrewd” politician but history will remember her as a leader “who stayed in power through repression, not popular mandate”. “Never in the history of this region has a politician stayed in power for such a long period despite lacking people’s mandate,” he said. “In fact, I would call her unpopular now as [Sunday’s] turnout has proven what percentage of people’s support Hasina and her party has.” Nazrul said Hasina has “set up a milestone before the world on how a leader can establish complete autocracy in a nation in the garb of democracy”. “But that’s not a legacy one should be proud of,” he said. Hasina has been praised by supporters for leading Bangladesh through a remarkable economic boom, largely on the back of the mostly female factory workforce powering its garment export industry. Bangladesh, one of the world’s poorest countries when it gained independence from Pakistan in 1971, has grown an average of more than 6 percent each year since 2009. Poverty has plummeted and more than 95 percent of the country’s 170 million people now have access to electricity, with per capita income overtaking India in 2021. Hasina also received international acclaim for opening Bangladesh’s doors to hundreds of thousands of Rohingya refugees fleeing a 2017 military crackdown in neighbouring Myanmar. She has been hailed for a decisive crackdown on hardline Muslim groups after five homegrown extremists stormed a Dhaka cafe popular with Western expatriates and killed 22 people in 2016. But Hasina’s intolerance towards dissent has given rise to resentment at home and expressions of concern from the Western powers. Five top Muslim leaders and a senior opposition figure were executed over the past decade after convictions for crimes against humanity committed during the country’s brutal 1971 liberation war. Instead of healing the wounds of that conflict, the trials triggered mass protests and deadly clashes. Her opponents branded the trials a farce, saying they were a politically motivated exercise designed to silence dissent. The United States imposed sanctions on an elite branch of Bangladesh’s security forces and seven of its top officers over charges of widespread human rights abuses. Meanwhile, the economy has also slowed sharply since the Russia-Ukraine war pushed up prices of fuel and food imports, forcing Bangladesh to turn last year to the International Monetary Fund for a $4.7bn bailout. Inflation was 9.5 percent in November, one of the highest in decades, and tackling it will be one of Hasina’s biggest challenges in her next term while the spotlight will be on how she deals with upholding democracy. Munshi Faiz Ahmed, former director-general of Bangladesh Institute of International and Strategic Studies, a state-funded think tank on security and strategic issues, called Hasina “perhaps the most strategic political maneuverer in Bangladesh’s history”. Ahmed, also a former Bangladeshi ambassador to China, told Al Jazeera that one should be mindful of the conditions in which Hasina operated in the last decade: a massive population cramped in a small land with scant mineral resources, a divided and opinionated public, and continuous pressure from the global and regional powers. “She skilfully handled all those factors and led Bangladesh to a position of prosperity and importance. As a politician, she is more competent than anyone else in recent history,” he said. In the aftermath of a tainted election, Ahmed said Hasina had been successful in tackling Western pressure so far and at the same time was able to establish good relations with China, India and Russia – all of which have backed her government. “It’s no longer a unipolar world, it’s rather multipolar. So, I don’t think her government will face any problem now.” Faisal Mahmud contributed from Dhaka, Bangladesh.",2024,1
https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/8/sheikh-hasina-wins-fifth-term-in-bangladesh-amid-turnout-controversy,1/8/2024,"Dhaka, Bangladesh – Sheikh Hasina has secured her fifth term as Bangladeshi prime minister in an election whose outcome was decided the moment its schedule was announced in early November when the main opposition boycotted the poll. The surprise was who came second.     Instead of any political party, independent candidates secured a total of 63 seats, the second highest after Hasina’s Awami League (AL), which won 222, creating a problem of finding a parliamentary opposition. The current opposition, the Jatiya Party, managed to secure just 11 of the 300 parliamentary seats, according to the Election Commission. Almost all the winning independent contenders were people who had been rejected by the AL but were asked by the party leadership to stand as “dummy candidates” to give the election a competitive veneer in front of the world. “This is a bizarre outcome of a bizarre election,” Shahidul Alam, a renowned Bangladeshi rights activist and photographer, told Al Jazeera. “Dummy candidates in a dummy election will now lead to a dummy parliament.” Shunned by the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) – the AL’s main political opponent – which wanted the balloting held under a neutral entity instead of Hasina’s administration, Sunday’s “one-sided election” was just a “mere formality” to put Hasina back in power again, analysts say. The only suspense, they added, was voter turnout, after Western governments put pressure on Hasina’s government to ensure a free, fair and participatory poll. After polling closed at 4pm (10:00 GMT on Sunday), the Election Commission (EC) said turnout was 40 percent. But many were doubtful it was even that high. “I don’t know about the rest of the country but I think I have not seen such an empty Dhaka in years,” Abdullah Yusuf, an engineer in the Dhanmondi area of the capital, told Al Jazeera. “It felt like the initial COVID days. I crossed two polling centres midday and didn’t see many people besides Awami League activists who were wearing badges. EC’s claim of 40 percent is quite absurd.”    Some analysts, meanwhile, pointed to confusion at the EC announcement. “It’s hard to believe the turnout was 40 percent, especially given the fact that the chief election commissioner himself uttered 28 percent first while briefing the media and then changed it to 40 percent all of a sudden,” said Sakhawat Hossain, a former election commissioner. The turnout figure, which was shown on the dashboard at the EC headquarters hours after the briefing, was 28 percent, and a photo of it was widely circulated in the country’s social media and received criticism. Al Jazeera checked and verified that figure. EC earlier declared at an hour before the poll closing that the turnout was about 27 percent. Al Jazeera visited at least 10 polling stations across the capital Dhaka in the last hour and did not see any voters. Sharmin Murshid, the head of the reputed election observer organisation Brotee, told Al Jazeera that a jump from 27 to 40 in a span of an hour or so was “ridiculous” and had “tainted the EC reputation severely”. “It was a sure way to further lose the confidence of the people and credibility which it did not have to start with,” she said. “This was not an election, rather it was an exercise in casting votes by one party for one party,” she added. BNP leaders, meanwhile, termed even 28 percent very high, saying that most of the polling booths across the country had been empty throughout the day. The opposition party earlier declared a 48-hour “hartal”, equivalent to a total strike, from Saturday morning, which it believed also reduced turnout. “In most pictures and footage shared in media and social platforms, you would find photos of dogs standing, lying down and basking in the sun along with police and a few Awami League activists,” said Abdul Moyeen Khan, a senior BNP leader, while briefing journalists after the election, “But no voters.” Khan said people had heeded their call to boycott ballots and show a “red card” to the election. “Even Awami League supporters didn’t bother to go to booths to cast their votes because they knew their candidates would win anyway,” he added. AL leaders, however, said the BNP’s plan to foil the election through “hartal” and “arson attacks” had not paid off because people did turn out to vote. “This is a victory for our democracy,” Obaidul Quader told the media after finding a clear lead in poll results, “People give BNP’s terrorism befitting reply through balloting.” Quader also said most people voted for their preferred candidates without any intimidation or interference in voting. “This was one of the most peaceful elections of the country,” he said. While the last two national elections were tainted with dozens of deaths and severe violence, Sunday’s poll saw only one death and very few clashes, making it one of the most peaceful polls in the South Asian nation’s history. “People of your country should be proud of holding such a peaceful election,” Hisham Kuhail, the CEO of the Central Election Commission of Palestine, one of several foreign observers of the poll, told a media briefing afterwards. Kuhail, however, avoided questions about voter turnout and said he was assessing only the technicalities of the voting process – whether voters were allowed access and whether voting took place systematically. “I cannot comment on the political scenario here. For that I need to stay at least a month,” he added. Russian observer Andrei Shutov also said the voting process was systematic and peaceful. “This election is legitimate,” he added. AKM Wahiduzzaman, the information and technology affairs secretary of the BNP, said there was no question it was peaceful because “there were no voters”. “But it is obviously not legitimate,” he said. The Awami League’s victory, he added, was “illegal and illegitimate” because people did not “legitimise them through votes”.",2024,1
https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/7/bangladesh-counts-votes-in-low-turnout-election-boycotted-by-opposition,1/7/2024,"Bangladesh election officials are counting votes after a controversial poll, fraught with violence and boycotted by the opposition, is guaranteed to give a fourth straight term to Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. Bangladeshis largely stayed away from the vote on Sunday as initial signs suggested a low turnout, despite widespread reports of carrot-and-stick inducements aimed at bolstering the poll’s legitimacy.     “Vote counting has begun,” said election commission spokesman Shariful Alam. Later on Sunday, local media reported that Hasina’s Awami League won 216 seats out of 299, independent candidates took 52, and the Jatiya Party took 11 seats. The results for the rest of the constituencies were still coming in. Official results from the election commission are expected on Monday morning. Turnout was 27.15 percent at 3pm (09:00 GMT), an hour before polls closed, the election commission said, compared with an overall turnout of more than 80 percent in the last election in 2018. Voting was cancelled at three centres due to irregularities, said Jahangir Alam, secretary of the commission. Independent election observer and civil society activist Badiul Alam Majumder told Al Jazeera he did not consider the vote a “proper election at all”. “It has a seriously low turnout – probably the lowest I have seen in my life,” he said, adding that his organisation did not officially monitor the vote this year.  Hasina, 76, urged citizens to cast their ballots and show their faith in the democratic process, branding the main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) a “terrorist organisation”. Accompanied by her daughter and other family members, Hasina voted at the capital Dhaka’s City College minutes after polling began. “Bangladesh is a sovereign country and people are my power,” she said after voting, adding that she hoped her party would win the people’s mandate, which would give it a fifth term since 1996. “I am trying my best to ensure that democracy should continue in this country.”    The BNP, whose ranks have been decimated by mass arrests, called a two-day nationwide strike through Sunday, urging people to not participate in what it called a “sham” election. BNP chief Tarique Rahman, speaking from Britain where he lives in exile, said he was worried about ballot stuffing. “I fear that the election commission may increase voter turnout by using fake votes,” he told AFP news agency. Hasina last year refused BNP demands to resign and allow a neutral authority to run the election, accusing the opposition of instigating antigovernment protests that have rocked the capital since late October and killed at least 14 people. Rights groups have warned of virtual one-party rule by Hasina’s Awami League in the South Asian country of 170 million people after the boycott by the BNP and some smaller allies. Tanvir Chowdhury, Al Jazeera correspondent in Dhaka, said there was a “lack of interest and enthusiasm” among the people. “The city is quiet and sombre. No one wants to speak freely on camera. People are saying off the record this is all very predictable. It is not an inclusive election.”  At least four people were killed on Friday in a passenger train fire that the government called arson. Several polling booths, schools and a Buddhist monastery were set ablaze days before the poll. A person in Munshiganj, south of the capital Dhaka, was hacked to death on Sunday morning, district police chief Mohammad Aslam Khan said, adding that it was unclear if the killing was related to political violence. Police in Chandpur district about 110km (70 miles) from Dhaka fired tear gas to disperse BNP supporters who had blocked roads to disrupt voting and threw stones at security forces, said district police chief Saiful Islam. Supporters of the Awami League and independent candidates clashed in some districts, amid allegations that ruling party cadres were stuffing sealed ballot papers in voting boxes, local media reported. Bangladesh deployed nearly 800,000 security forces to guard polling booths and troops were mobilised nationwide to assist in maintaining peace. About 120 million voters were choosing from nearly 2,000 candidates for 300 directly elected parliamentary seats. There are 436 independent candidates, the most since 2001. The opposition BNP, its top leaders either in jail or exile, says the Awami League has propped up “dummy” candidates as independents to try to make the election look credible, a claim the ruling party denies. Hasina said she did not need to prove the credibility of the election to anyone. “What is important is if the people of Bangladesh will accept this election.” Politics in the world’s eighth-most populous country was long dominated by the rivalry between Hasina, the daughter of the country’s founding leader, and two-time premier Khaleda Zia, wife of a former military ruler. Hasina has been credited with turning around Bangladesh’s economy and the key garment industry. But critics accuse her of authoritarianism, human rights violations, crackdowns on free speech and suppression of dissent. Her Awami League party faced almost no effective rivals in the seats it contested, but it avoided fielding candidates in a few constituencies, an apparent effort to avoid the legislature being branded a one-party institution. Michael Kugelman, director of the South Asia Institute at the Wilson Center, said none of those contesting would be able to mount much of a challenge to Hasina’s party. “The outcome is all but guaranteed, and that is that the Awami League will return [to power] again,” he said. “Bangladesh’s democracy will be in an extremely precarious state once the election is done.”   ",2024,1
https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/7/thousands-of-rohingya-homeless-after-fire-in-bangladesh,1/7/2024,"Thousands of Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh have been left without shelter after a fire ripped through a refugee camp, burning hundreds of homes, officials say. The blaze tore through the tightly packed complex of bamboo and tarpaulin shelters in the early hours of the day at a camp in the country’s southeast, refugee commissioner Mizanur Rahman said on Sunday. There is suspicion of arson, the official has said.     Bangladesh is home to hundreds of thousands of Rohingya, many of whom have taken refuge there since a 2017 military crackdown on the mainly Muslim minority in neighbouring Myanmar. Those events are now the subject of a United Nations genocide probe. “At least 711 shelters were fully burned and 63 were partially damaged,” Rahman said, adding that five education centres and two mosques were also destroyed. He said the fire made 4,000 people homeless.  There were no casualties, and the fire has been brought under control, he added. “We have ordered a probe into the fire,” he added. “We suspect it is an act of arson”. Shafiqul Islam, the head of the Ukhiya Fire Station, separately told The Associated Press news agency that the fire broke out at approximately midnight at the Kutupalong camp in Ukhiya and spread quickly, fanned by strong winds. “The fire was big, and it destroyed about 1,040 shelters in the camp,” he said. “We took about two hours to get the blaze under control, engaging 10 fire units from Ukhiya and other stations in the district.” Islam said that although it is not confirmed, preliminary statements from the refugees suggested that it was caused by a mud oven. The UN refugee agency said the “large fire damaged many refugee shelters”, adding that it was “supporting people affected”. Fires in the dozens of Rohingya refugee camps in Bangladesh are common, especially during the dry season from November to April. But many of the camps are also riven by violence between rival Rohingya groups. Police say security in the camps has worsened, with more than 60 refugees killed in turf wars and drug-related clashes last year, the highest number on record. In March 2023, a fire in Kutupalong camp – one of the world’s largest refugee settlements – destroyed 2,000 shelters. Two years earlier, at least 15 Rohingya were killed and 50,000 left homeless after a blaze in the same camp. Conditions in Myanmar have worsened since a military takeover in 2021 and attempts to send back the Rohingya refugees have failed. Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has said on several occasions that the refugees would not be sent back by force. Rights groups say conditions in Myanmar are not conducive for repatriation. Muslim Rohingya face widespread discrimination in Buddhist-majority Myanmar, where they are denied citizenship and other constitutional rights.   ",2024,1
https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/6/bangladesh-polling-booths-set-ablaze-opposition-starts-election-strike,1/6/2024,"Polling booths were set on fire in Bangladesh on the eve of Sunday’s general elections, hours after four people were killed in a suspected arson attack on a commuter train. This came as Bangladesh’s main opposition party, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party, started a 48-hour general strike on Saturday, calling on people to boycott the vote because it says the government of incumbent Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina cannot guarantee its fairness.     Police on Saturday said unidentified arsonists set fire to at least five primary schools, including four polling stations. They were investigating fires in Gazipur, on the outskirts of the capital, Dhaka, suspected to have been set in the middle of the night by those aiming to disrupt the elections, which the main opposition party has pledged to boycott. “We have intensified patrolling and remain on high alert,” said Gazipur police chief Kazi Shafiqul Alam. The election commission has asked authorities to increase security around polling stations.    Arsonists also attacked polling booths in the northeastern districts of Moulvibazar and Habiganj, police said, with similar incidents reported elsewhere in the past two days. Police in the coastal district of Khulna arrested two people on Thursday night accused of trying to set fire to a school, which serve as voting stations. The following day, another bid to set fire to a primary school nearby was averted, said Saidur Rahman, police chief of the district. The Khaleda Zia-led BNP, and numerous other opposition parties, have boycotted the elections, saying they are intended to solidify the rule of Prime Minister Hasina. Hasina, 76, is assured of a fourth consecutive term in Sunday’s vote, which observers have criticised as one-sided. On Saturday morning, a small group of BNP supporters marched across Dhaka’s Shahbagh neighbourhood, calling on people to join the strike. Another rally by about 200 left-wing protesters took place outside the National Press Club to denounce the election. “The government is again playing with fire. The government has resorted to its old tactics of holding a one-sided election,” said Ruhul Kabir Rizvi, a senior BNP official. Meanwhile, police apprehended seven members of the opposition party, accused of an alleged pre-election arson attack on a commuter train on Friday, in which four people were killed. Among those arrested in the capital early on Saturday was Nabiullah Nabi, a senior BNP official, along with six other party activists. “Nabi funded and masterminded the attack,” Dhaka Metropolitan Police spokesperson Faruk Hossain told the AFP news agency by phone. Foreign Minister AK Abdul Momen said the timing of the incident showed an “absolute intention to hinder the festivity, safety and security of the democratic processes of the country”.   “This reprehensible incident, undoubtedly orchestrated by those with malicious intent, strikes at the very heart of our democratic values,” he added in a statement. However, BNP spokesperson AKM Wahiduzzaman told AFP the attacks were pre-planned “acts of sabotage” by the ruling government, aimed at “discrediting the non-violent movement of the BNP”. He said the government was aiming to “divert people’s attention away from the sham election”. Eight people were critically injured in the train fire, officials said. “All eight, including two children, have burnt their respiratory tracts,” said Dr Samanta Lal Sen of a state-run specialist burns hospital in the capital. “We are closely monitoring them,” he told reporters.",2024,1
https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/6/vote-doesnt-count-bangladeshs-bizarre-election-tests-ties-with-west,1/6/2024,"Dhaka, Bangladesh — Bangladesh is going to hold its national election tomorrow amid a boycott by the principal opposition party, a crackdown on protesters and intense pressure from Western countries who have warned for months about a lack of the vote’s credibility damaging the nation’s democracy. With the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), the main political opposition, not contesting, Sunday’s outcome is almost a foregone conclusion, with Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina’s Awami League widely expected to win its fourth consecutive term.     But that win might come with a loss – political pundits and analysts say the manner in which the election is being conducted could affect the South Asian nation’s diplomatic and economic relationships with Western partners, most notably, the United States. The Biden administration has repeatedly criticised the Bangladesh government for its handling of the election, and in September declared visa restrictions on select individuals accused of subverting the democratic process. Bangladesh’s previous two elections were also similarly tainted: the BNP boycotted the election in 2014 and the 2018 vote was marred by allegations of major vote-rigging. A more significant backlash from the US could strain Bangladesh’s already fragile economy and take its seething political unrest – witnessed in large protests over recent months – to a boiling point. The ruling Awami League has tried to give the election a competitive veneer by fielding a number of what they, themselves call “dummy candidates” and running full-fledged election campaigns which ended early on Friday morning. The BNP, meanwhile, has declared a 48-hour nationwide strike from Saturday after conducting its own campaign urging people not to vote. “Boycott the election for public interest, for civil liberties and in the interest of basic freedom of the people,” Ruhul Kabir Rizvi, the joint secretary general of the BNP and one of the few top leaders who are out of jail, told the media on Friday. He also urged the government not to “push the country towards danger by forcing dummy and one-sided elections,” and warned that “power cannot be retained by cheating the people in this way”. To many common people, this election no longer makes sense. “Awami League is urging people to vote, knowing their vote will not matter as it will win anyway,” said Tanvir Siddiqui, a businessman in Dhaka. “And BNP is declaring hartal (a protest) on an election day to stop people going to the booth! I have never seen anything more bizarre than this.” When asked whether he would vote in Sunday’s election, Siddiqui told Al Jazeera, “What’s the point? Our vote has stopped counting since the 2014 election.” Sharmeen Murshid, who heads the reputed election observer group Brotee, said her organisation, too, was confused about what it would do on Sunday. “It’s like Awami League vs [Awami League] dummy candidates. What will we observe and how could we measure whether the election was free and fair?” she questioned. Murshid was also sceptical about the likelihood of a reasonable voter turnout. “AL has a huge supporter base but I am not sure even many of their own supporters will bother to visit the poll booth,” she said. For the Awami League, voter turnout, however, is a major concern. “In fact, this is our only concern now,” said Bahauddin Nasim, joint secretary general of the party. Since Bangladesh’s democratic transition from military rule in the early 1990s, the country has witnessed two one-sided elections. In 1996, when the BNP was in power and the Awami League boycotted the election, the turnout was only 28 percent. In 2014, when the roles were reversed – the Awami League was in power and the BNP boycotted – only 39 percent of voters showed up at polling booths. In both cases, the boycotting opposition parties said even those numbers were inflated. Nasim, however, said he was hopeful about a strong turnout and cited the millions of new voters whom he claimed would be keen to exercise their democratic right. As per the election commission’s data, about 15.6 million new voters have registered since the last election of 2018. The country’s voting population now stands at 119.6 million. “Most of these voters are very excited about casting their first votes,” said Nasim, “And by holding the election on time, we are giving them this opportunity.” Nasim also said that since the BNP wasn’t able to secure any significant number of parliamentary seats in the last three elections, they are soon fading away from people’s minds. “Besides, 28 out of 44 registered political parties are taking part in this election. There are 1970 candidates for 300 seats in the parliament. This will be a participatory election,” Nasim added. Dhaka-based political analyst Zahed Ur Rahman told Al Jazeera the Awami League’s main aim in this election is to show the world that even without the main political opposition in Bangladesh’s essentially “two-party politics,” the turnout could be high. “This would help them to establish the narrative that Bangladesh’s democracy has evolved into a multi-party democracy where the BNP is no longer relevant while Awami League very much is,” Rahman said. “But I am not sure who is buying that. Surely neither the common people nor the whole world. Probably Awami League itself is not convinced about it,” Rahman added. Rahman described the election as a “stage-managed mockery of democracy”. More than the outcome or the process of the poll, he said he was worried about its aftermath. “Yes, the BNP is not participating but the election doesn’t mean the poll day, rather it means the whole period since the declaration of the election schedule. We have seen how the Awami League has repressed the opposition with brute force and through court cases,” said Rahman. In the last six weeks, the ruling Awami League had launched what the US-based Human Rights Watch (HRW) has termed a “violent autocratic crackdown” against the BNP and arrested thousands of their top leaders and activists. More than a dozen were also killed in police violence. The US and European nations should take of these recent events in deciding whether they want to give legitimacy to a post-election Hasina government, Rahman said, if they “are true to their words of promoting democracy”. Sreeradha Datta, professor at the Jindal School of International Affairs in Sonepat, India,  however, told Al Jazeera that she doesn’t expect any “dramatic reactions” from the US or other Western countries to a Hasina victory. India, Bangladesh’s neighbour and South Asia’s biggest power, will almost certainly go to “congratulate Hasina and the Awami League” and their bilateral relationship will be back to “business as usual,” Datta said. “The USA will point out the anomalies in the process but when all other important neighbours like China, India and Russia accept the election verdict there is very little that the USA can do apart from sanctions which they have already threatened,” she said.",2024,1
https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/5/at-least-four-killed-in-bangladesh-train-fire-before-elections,1/5/2024,"At least four people have been killed and others injured in Bangladesh after a passenger train caught fire in a suspected arson attack, according to police officials. The incident on Friday adds to a tense environment in the country in advance of Sunday’s elections, which the opposition is seeking to boycott and disrupt with a general strike.     Fire service officer Rakjibul Hasan said that at about 9pm (15:00 GMT), at least four coaches caught fire on the Benapole Express, which was arriving in the capital Dhaka from the western city of Jessore. The fire rapidly raced through the train. Residents initially tried to put the fire out, before seven fire engines joined the extinguishing efforts, Khandaker al-Moin of the Rapid Action Battalion unit of the police said at the scene. It took nearly two hours to douse the blaze, he said. Mohid Uddin, deputy chief of Dhaka Metropolitan Police, described the incident as act of planned sabotage to create panic among the citizens before the elections. “We will definitely find out the culprits involved in such heinous attacks,” Uddin said. Police chief Anwar Hossain also told the AFP news agency, “We suspect the fire incident was an act of sabotage,” without giving more details. An unnamed rescuer told private broadcaster Somoy TV that hundreds had rushed to pull people out of the burning train. “We rescued many. But the fire spread quickly,” he said. Somoy TV said some Indian citizens were also travelling on the train.    Bangladesh has frequently experienced violence surrounding elections, and Sunday’s voting comes amid an increasingly polarised political culture led by two powerful women – current Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia, an opposition leader currently under house arrest. This year, following Hasina’s refusal to accept Zia’s Bangladesh National Party’s (BNP) demands for a neutral caretaker government to conduct the polls, the BNP has chosen to boycott the elections. Meanwhile, at least three people have been killed in violence attributed to political clashes since the election campaigning officially began on December 18. Campaigning officially came to an end on Friday morning, but there is widespread speculation that this vote – which could see Hasina win a fourth consecutive and a fifth overall term in office – will be tampered with. The international community has expressed concern over the conduct of the vote. Charles Whiteley, the European Union ambassador to the country, said in a letter to the Bangladesh Election Commission that the bloc would not send a full observer team, because “it is not sufficiently clear whether the necessary conditions will be met.” The UN Secretary-General’s Associate Spokesperson Florencia Soto Nino in New York said on Wednesday, “We’re watching the process closely, and we hope that all elections happen in a transparent and organised manner.” On Thursday, Hasina, addressing a huge campaign rally at Fatullah near Dhaka, urged all to maintain peace. The Election Commission has announced polling will be held in 299 constituencies out of 300 across the country on Sunday.",2024,1
https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/5/bangladesh-elections-a-timeline-of-controversy,1/5/2024,"On Sunday, Bangladesh, a nation of 170 million people, will go to the polls to elect a new government in the country’s 12th general election. But in a country with a chequered history of violence and protests against dubious polls, the vote is already courting controversy.     Since 1971, when the country broke away from Pakistan, only four of Bangladesh’s 11 elections have been considered to be “free and fair”. The rest have frequently been mired in violence, protests and allegations of vote rigging. This year, following Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina’s refusal to accept the opposition Bangladesh National Party’s (BNP) demands for a neutral caretaker government to conduct the polls, the BNP has chosen to boycott the elections. Caretaker governments have in the past delivered results generally considered credible – and, usually, a win for the opposition. There is widespread speculation that this vote – which could see Hasina win a fourth consecutive and a fifth overall term in office – will be tampered with. Again. The international community has expressed concern over the conduct of the vote. Charles Whiteley, the European Union ambassador to the country, said in a letter to the Bangladesh Election Commission that the bloc would not send a full observer team, because “it is not sufficiently clear whether the necessary conditions will be met.” The country also deployed the military on Wednesday to monitor the elections amid fears of violence. Here’s a potted history of Bangladesh’s controversial elections. After overseeing the breakaway of Bangladesh from Pakistan, the ruling Awami League, chaired by independence leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, conducted the country’s first-ever elections on March 7, 1973. But, despite being the favourites to win, the Awami League engineered the kidnapping of opposition leaders and, in some constituencies, stuffed ballot papers. The party then won 293 of the 300 seats in parliament in a landslide that almost eliminated other political parties in the house, including Jatiya Samajtantrik Dal and Bashani, which won one parliamentary seat each. Those polls marked the beginning of autocratic rule in the new country. In 1974, Rahman followed up by banning all opposition parties as well as most press members from parliament, essentially turning Bangladesh into a one-party state. Mujibur Rahman was assassinated in 1975 and the Bangladeshi military took power for the next decade and a half. Presidential and parliamentary elections between 1978 and 1979 were held under the leadership of former army chief Ziaur Rahman, credited with instituting a multi-party system and rescuing the distressed state institutions from Mujibur Rahman’s rule. His newly founded Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) won an overwhelming majority. The Awami League, now the main opposition party, claimed the vote had been rigged. In 1981, following Ziaur Rahman’s assassination, his deputy, Abdus Sattar, held general elections on November 15. The BNP again won with 65 percent of the vote. Hussain Muhammad Ershad, who was army chief, took power in a 1982 coup. The May 7, 1986 parliamentary elections and the October 15, 1986 presidential vote that followed saw his Jatiya Party win the overwhelming majority amid opposition boycotts. The elections had low attendance and Ershad’s government was reported to have padded the numbers. It was widely seen as a sham. In 1988, another widely discredited vote was held amid intense protests calling for Ershad’s removal. The Awami League, led by Sheikh Hasina (Mujibur Rahman’s daughter), and the BNP, under Khaleda Zia (Ziaur Rahman’s widow) banded together to lead the protests, resulting in the popular uprising of 1990 that forced Ershad to resign. All major parties took part in the February 27, 1991 elections under a caretaker government led by Shahabuddin Ahmed, the chief justice of the Supreme Court and a future president. The elections were seen as neutral and delivered a narrow victory to Zia’s BNP, which overtook the Awami League with 250,000 votes. The BNP went on to secure 140 parliament seats, while the Awami League clinched 88 seats. Yet another controversial election followed this one, however. On February 15, 1996, opposition parties boycotted scheduled general elections and only 21 percent of registered voters turned out. Tensions between the Awami League and the ruling BNP had simmered over in 1994, when parliamentary by-elections were held. The opposition claimed the votes were rigged and started to press for Zia’s resignation and for her handover to a caretaker government – as happened in 1991. That did not happen, so in February 1996, the BNP won elections unchallenged. The administration only lasted 12 days, following strikes by opposition parliament members. On June 12, 1996, new elections took place, this time under a caretaker government. It saw a large turnout of voters – at just under 75 percent – and was considered neutral. Sheikh Hasina won her first term with the Awami League. The party secured 146 parliament seats, just ahead of the BNP which won 116 seats. The 2001 elections took place without much drama in October, once again under a caretaker government. The previous parliament (the seventh in the country’s history) was the first ever to complete its five-year term and had been dissolved in July. Some 1,935 candidates including members of 54 parties and 484 independents ran for 300 seats, with 30 more seats reserved for women. Voter turnout was high – 75 percent – and the BNP won 193 seats with close to 40 percent of the national vote. While the Awami League also won over 40 percent of the national vote, it only secured 62 seats under Bangladesh’s first-past-the-post electoral system. Khaleda Zia, leader of the BNP, was invited to form a government. While the elections themselves were uneventful – international observers declared them to be “free and fair” – there was some violence targeting minority Hindus in the aftermath. Elections that should have taken place in 2006 never happened because the outgoing BNP and the main opposition, Awami League, failed to agree on a candidate to head the necessary caretaker government. At the end of October, the country’s president, Iajuddin Ahmed declared himself leader of the caretaker government and announced that elections would take place in January 2007. A bitter row over fake names being included on the list of candidates led to riots and violence in the country – thousands of protesters blockaded the country’s transport system and the country descended into a political crisis lasting until 2008. The military stepped in when Ahmed declared a national emergency and the Awami League withdrew from the elections in protest. Elections were finally held on December 29, 2008, with an 80 percent turnout – the highest the country had ever seen. This time the Awami League formed a coalition – the Grand Alliance – with other opposition parties and was led by Sheikh Hasina. Khaleda Zia once again led the BNP. The Awami alliance won in a landslide, taking 230 seats with 48 percent of the popular vote. The BNP and its allies, who had also formed a coalition, took just 30 seats with 32.5 percent of the vote. The military-run caretaker government formally handed over power in January 2009. Following the political crisis of 2006 – 2008, the Awami League decided to abolish the requirement for a caretaker government to oversee elections in 2011. Hasina, the prime minister, was highly critical of the previous military-led caretaker government which had delayed elections for two years and which, she pointed out, was unelected. A parliamentary vote on the amendment to remove the caretaker provision was passed by 291 to one after it was boycotted by the main opposition BNP. A crackdown on the opposition followed. Prior to the elections that were held on January 5, 2014, BNP leader Zia was put under house arrest and there were widespread reports of violence towards other opposition members. Opposition parties, including the BNP, boycotted the vote and Hasina’s Awami League won in a landslide, clinching 234 seats in parliament. In 2018, electronic voting was introduced in Bangladesh. But the BNP and other opposition parties accused the ruling Awami League of rigging the general elections on December 30, 2018. Reports of violence against opposition BNP members and supporters, as well as voter suppression, marred the polls again. The government also shut down mobile internet in the lead-up to election day, claiming it wanted to stop the spread of fake news around the vote. Hasina’s Awami League, after merging with the Jatiya Party to form the Grand Alliance, won in another landslide. The Grand Alliance took more than 90 percent of parliament seats. Kamal Hossain who led the Jatiya Oikya Front – BNP alliance following a ban on Zia for corruption convictions, won just seven seats. Hossain criticised the elections and called for them to be held again, with no success. With its demands for a caretaker government still being ignored by Hasina’s ruling party, the BNP is again boycotting Sunday’s elections. The party has led mass strikes and demonstrations to press home its request, but to no avail. The ruling Awami League is generally seen to have the electoral system largely under its influence by now, and these elections are expected to be a replay of recent polls. Prime Minister Hasina is likely to win a majority for her fifth term in office, sealing her government as the longest-serving administration in Bangladesh’s history.",2024,1
https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/4/the-year-of-elections-is-2024-democracys-biggest-test-ever,1/4/2024,"It’s the year of the vote. Countries that are home to nearly half of the world’s population will pick their governments in elections in 2024 – something that has never happened in a single year before. Starting with Bangladesh on January 7, the polls include seven out of the world’s 10 most populous nations: India, the United States, Indonesia, Pakistan, Russia and Mexico are the others.     Some are established democracies, others are fledgling ones, and still others are effectively autocracies with votes but few real options for the electorate to choose from. Yet, amid growing concerns that democracies as a whole are backsliding – worries articulated by nonprofits like the Swedish V-Dem Institute and the US-based Freedom House – the elections in this mixed bag of nations represent a watershed year for the concept of democracy itself, according to cultural and political sociologist Andrew Perrin of Johns Hopkins University. From increased ethnic violence to steps aimed at weakening judicial and other checks on the power of the executive, the threats to democracy are real, say experts. But Perrin noted that there are countervailing pressures too. The popularity of democracy as measured by public opinion remains high. A survey of over 36, 000 respondents from across 30 countries conducted by Open Society Foundations in 2023 backs this up. More than 80 percent of survey respondents said they wanted to live in a democracy. That appeal now faces its stiffest test in a single year. Here are 10 key elections in 2024 that could shape the world, and the future of democracy. Incumbent Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina is seeking a fifth term in office after an intense crackdown on opposition parties and activists. Hasina, who belongs to the Awami League, has been in power since 2009. The main opposition, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), has boycotted the elections, citing government interference. It had demanded that a caretaker government be allowed to conduct the election – the Awami League government rejected that demand. The BNP’s top leadership is either jailed or in exile. Several political activists including BNP leaders have faced arrests and violence at the hands of police and ruling party supporters. In December 2023, Human Rights Watch reported that at least 10,000 opposition activists were arrested in the month following a planned rally by the BNP on October 28. Rights groups and countries such as the US have expressed concern about the violence and potential lack of fairness in the elections. Additionally, there are concerns about corruption scandals and an economic downturn. While Bangladesh’s growing economy has traditionally been a stabilising force in the country’s politics, labour unrest and protests for higher wages, along with diminishing purchasing power, are adding strain. “Bangladesh’s 2024 election can become the most consequential election in the history of the country,” said Ali Riaz, chair of the Department of Politics and Government at Illinois State University. “The country is standing at the crossroads of becoming a de facto one-party state and reversing its [democratic] course.” Riaz explained that the lack of a viable opposition can lead to an autocracy. But if the West responds to what many are describing as a sham election by imposing sanctions on Bangladesh, it could hurt the country’s working classes the most. “If any punitive measure is taken by the Western countries, the situation will have devastating impacts on the lives of the poor and middle class, who are already suffering”, he said. Bangladesh has a population of 170 million people. More than 1,800 candidates will be contesting 300 seats in Bangladesh’s national parliament. A total of 27 political parties have registered. Self-ruled Taiwan, which is claimed by Beijing, will elect its president on January 13. The president will replace incumbent Tsai Ing-Wen and navigate through a critical phase of Taiwan’s history. Tsai of the independence-leaning Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) was elected in 2016. Ever since then, China has intensified its pressure on the island by conducting military activities around the island and encouraging Taipei’s few remaining formal diplomatic allies to switch recognition to Beijing. The three candidates running for president are Lai Ching-te from the DPP who is known to be even more independence-leaning than Tsai, moderate Kuomintang leader Hou You-yi and former Taipei mayor Ko Wen-je from the Taiwan People’s Party. The stakes are high as China has warned that there is a risk of war if the DPP continues to stay in power. While DPP’s Lai is the frontrunner, his opposition is arguing that the ruling party’s posture risks creating a security risk for Taiwan in the form of a possible war. The US on the other hand, is a significant international ally of Taiwan and provides Taiwan with the means for self-defence. Hence, the Taiwanese elections have also become a theatre for the competing interests of the rival superpowers. Pakistan — which votes for its national legislature on February 8 – has been facing a turbulent political landscape since its former Prime Minister Imran Khan, who was elected in July 2018, was removed in a no-confidence vote in April 2022. An intense crackdown on his party Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) and political activists has sparked concerns about the credibility of the election, and the role of the country’s all-powerful military establishment in it. The country is currently run by a caretaker government, led by interim Prime Minister Anwar ul-Haq Kakar. It has a population of more than 241 million people, and 127 million registered voters, according to data released by the election commission in September 2023. Political tensions escalated on May 9, 2023, when paramilitary security officials arrested Khan in an anticorruption case that he has denied and said was politically motivated. Following his removal, Khan had openly opposed Pakistan’s military apparatus which has been embedded in the country’s politics and economy since its inception. In the month following May 9, about 5,000 supporters and aides of PTI were arrested, according to Interior Minister Rana Sanaullah. Several members also left the party amid this atmosphere. Last week, Khan’s nomination bid to contest the elections was also rejected. “Never before in Pakistan’s history have we had such an impression of unfairness and the election process starting a month or two or before the actual elections,” said Rasul Bakhsh Rais, professor of political science at the Lahore University of Management Sciences. The crackdown from the Pakistani establishment has discouraged political participation and added to the impression that elections will be rigged in favour of one of the country’s major and dynastic political parties, Pakistan Muslim League (Nawaz) or Pakistan People’s Party (PPP), according to Rais. “We may not see a spirited participation of the people,” said Rais, adding that he expects the voter turnout of the forthcoming elections to be the lowest in Pakistan’s history. Former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, who was in exile for several years following a spate of cases and convictions on corruption charges, has returned to Pakistan. Courts have overturned past convictions against him, and many analysts see him as the military’s favoured candidate to lead the country next. Also in February, Indonesians will vote in the world’s largest single-day election to choose their president, vice president and nearly 20,000 representatives for district, provincial and national parliaments. Although free and fair elections have been widely celebrated in Indonesia since its democratic transition in 1998, the democracy is still dominated by political, business and military figures who established their prominence during Soeharto’s authoritarian rule, writes Sana Jaffrey for the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. She added that power has largely shifted among the Soeharto-era elites. Even though the current president, outsider Joko “Jokowi” Widodo has subverted this tradition by winning the highly competitive 2014 election through popular vote, he has learned that he needs to play by the rules of the elites. Now that Jokowi has completed his maximum two terms, three candidates are vying to succeed him: Prabowo Subianto, Ganjar Pranowo and Anies Baswedan. Defence Minister Prabowo, 72, is representing the nationalist right-wing Gerindra party. His running mate is Widodo’s son, the 36-year-old Gibran Rakabuming Raka, who is controversial due to allegations of inexperience and being a “nepo baby”. Besides this, Prabowo was allegedly involved in kidnappings of student activists in 1998 and is accused of other human rights abuses. Despite the controversy, Prabowo seems to be the frontrunner in the race. Gibran was allowed to contest elections despite being under 40, the minimum age of running candidates, because he previously held public office as the current mayor of Surakarta. This caveat was introduced by Indonesia’s Constitutional Court in October. Jokowi’s governing secular-nationalist Democratic Party of Struggle (PDI-P) has selected Ganjar as its candidate. Meanwhile, Anies is favoured by conservative Muslims and Islamist groups. He chose Muhaimin Iskandar, the chairman of the Islamist National Awakening Party (PKB), as his running mate. After the first presidential debate in December, Usman Hamid, the head of Amnesty Indonesia, noted that Ganjar and Anies talked more about freedom of expression, accountability for violence by security forces and resolution for past human rights abuses during the debate, while Prabowo – who has been in power – did not. In the spring of 2014, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Narendra Modi was sworn in as India’s 14th prime minister. A decade later, he appears poised to win a third straight term in office in what will be history’s largest-ever democratic exercise: 900 million people voters will choose their next government. Running against Modi’s Hindu majoritarian Bharatiya Janata Party is a coalition of 28 parties, called the Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance (INDIA). INDIA is led by the main opposition, the Indian National Congress party spearheaded by Rahul Gandhi, whose father (Rajiv Gandhi), grandmother (Indira Gandhi) and great-grandfather (Jawaharlal Nehru) were all prime ministers. Over the decade of the BJP government’s rule, the country has seen what the ruling party’s critics call an erosion of democracy. Academic and writer Apoorvanand told Al Jazeera that autonomous institutions including the election commission have lost their autonomy. In December, an investigation revealed that the Indian government was likely surveilling high-profile journalists using the Pegasus spyware. Earlier in the same month, 141 opposition lawmakers were suspended from parliament. The shrinking space for the opposition and attempts to coerce the media have emerged as prominent issues in these elections alongside a struggling economy, rising unemployment and attacks by Hindu nationalists on religious minority communities. Parts of the country, such as the northeast state of Manipur, have been on fire for months after ethnic clashes broke out in May. Meanwhile, the far-right Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) – the ideological parent of the BJP – has increasingly been able to influence the nation’s textbooks, sparking concerns that the next generation of Indians could imbibe myth over science and history, and bigotry over secular values. “These elections are very crucial because this is the only change to revive democracy in India,” Apoorvanand said. Yet, Modi remains vastly popular in major parts of the country. The BJP steamrolled opposition parties to triumph in a series of state elections in December, signposting its political strength entering 2024. Despite challenges, the size of India’s economy has overtaken those of France and the United Kingdom. India also became the fourth country to have a successful moon landing and hosted the G20 summit.   Between May and August, South Africa is expected to hold its seventh national election since the end of apartheid in 1994. South Africa has a population of 60 million and about 27 million registered voters. Since 1994, the African National Congress (ANC) has held uninterrupted power, but supporters fear the party’s votes will fall short of the 50 percent needed to win this year. Led by President Cyril Ramaphosa, the ANC’s support has dipped to 45 percent, according to an October 2023 poll by the Social Research Foundation. Corruption scandals linked to government officials have become frequent while Ramaphosa also pardoned his predecessor Jacob Zuma who refused to testify about corruption and state capture during his tenure. ANC’s primary opponent is the Democratic Alliance (DA) led by legislator John Steenhuisen. He has formed alliances with smaller parties to remove the ANC. However, the DA ranks lower than the ANC in polling, while many Black politicians have left in recent years, hurting its potential to be seen as an inclusive institution. Mexico is gearing up for its largest-ever election on June 2 that could see it elect a woman as its president for the first time. Mexico has a population of about 129 million and approximately 96 million registered voters. For the first time, all 32 states in Mexico will be holding elections concurrently while 20,000 positions including the presidency, congressional seats, governorships and local offices will be filled by contesting candidates. Better known by his initials – AMLO – Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador from the Morena party currently leads the nation but the country has a one-term limit. Claudia Sheinbaum, a scientist and former Mexico City mayor, is the new face of Morena and also a frontrunner with a significant lead in polls. She has pledged to address challenges such as gang violence and to try and use nearshoring – a rising trend of the US relocating business operations to Mexico to cut costs – to help the country’s economy. Xochitl Galvez, a senator with Indigenous roots who represents the National Action Party, has set out to challenge Morena’s dominance and is campaigning on the promise to combat violence. AMLO’s term has been the bloodiest in Mexico’s history, with a record number of murders. The so-called “war on drugs”, which was initiated three presidential terms ago, has failed to reduce violence. The next government will be tested on whether it will continue with a militarised strategy or explore alternative, less punitive policies. Deep inequalities in access to quality healthcare and education persist. Every five years, European Union (EU) citizens participate in elections to choose their representatives in the European Parliament (EP) – the only directly elected transnational assembly globally. These elections take place across all 27 EU member countries. Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) shape and decide new laws that govern various aspects of life in the EU from healthcare to employment. MEPs also elect the President of the European Commission – currently Ursula von der Leyen, the EU’s first female president. The elections will take place from June 6 to June 9. Election days are divided between countries. For example, the Netherlands conducts elections on a Thursday, while France holds them on a Sunday. A total of 720 MEPs will be elected while members of national political parties can also contest. Some of the key issues in this cycle include climate policies, immigration laws, security and defence, especially amid the multiple conflicts plaguing the world, from the Middle East to Russia’s war on Ukraine. On November 5, the US will vote for its president, all seats in the House of Representatives and a third of the seats in the Senate. The presidential race this year seems to be reminiscent of 2020, where Democrat Joe Biden, who is the current president, faced off against Republican Donald Trump, whom he defeated four years ago. Trump has a massive lead over Republican rivals Ron DeSantis and Nikki Haley — despite multiple indictments against him and his absence from all the Republican debates so far. Trump’s popularity among Republicans remains unshaken because he has reshaped the Republican Party. “One of the mistakes people make is thinking that the group of Americans out there in public who are Republicans has stayed the same,” said Perrin. Many traditional libertarians or relatively religious conservatives have left the party in the wake of the Trump 2016 victory. At the same time, a segment of what gets called the white working class left the Democrats and joined the Republican Party, he explained. “The people who are now in the party are people who were drawn into it by the popularity of Donald Trump.” Perrin does not think candidates besides Biden and Trump are likely to stand a chance unless a legal problem or health issue comes up, “They both hold really commanding leads within their electorates”. Perrin believes that the outcomes of the election could serve as a bellwether for the rest of the world and a victory of the Republicans could mean American isolationism affecting other parts of the world. “Because when Trump says that we will take care of Americans, and we will act only in the interests of Americans globally, that’s also a signal to the rest of the world that they should behave in a sort of self-interested way.” While it is clear that the outcome of US elections will influence the rest of the world, whether the outcomes of elections in the rest of the world will influence the US is a different story. “From a social science standpoint, I think Americans are not particularly good at observing the rest of the world,” said Perrin. Ghana will head to the polls on December 7 to elect the members of the country’s parliament as well as the successor to President Nana Akufo-Addo of the New Patriotic Party (NPP). Akufo-Addo of the centre-right and liberal-conservative NPP was sworn in as president in 2017 after winning the 2016 elections. He won again in 2020 and was sworn in for his second term in 2021. In both of these elections, he narrowly defeated John Mahama of the social democratic National Democratic Congress (NDC). After the 2020 elections, Mahama disputed the results and filed a petition in the Supreme Court, and begrudgingly accepted defeat when it was rejected in March 2021. Mahama, who was the president of Ghana from 2012 up until 2017, is contesting again this year but not against Akufo-Addo since the constitution bars him from running for a third term. Instead, the NPP elected Vice President Mahamudu Bawumia after he won the primaries. Bawumia will be the first northerner and Muslim to contest presidential elections under the NPP, a movement dominated by ethnic Akan, which analysts say will pose another challenge for Mahama, who is also from the north. The West African gold and cocoa exporter currently grapples with the worst economic turmoil in years. Inflation hovers at a record 50.3 percent, the highest in 21 years. Government expenditure during the pandemic led to high public debt amounting to $48.9bn as of September. That represents 76 percent of gross domestic product (GDP). Whoever gets elected will face the challenge of pulling Ghana out of its economic turmoil.     ",2024,1
https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/4/as-opposition-boycott-tarnishes-vote-young-bangladeshis-seek-new-narrative,1/4/2024,"At a technology centre in Bangladesh’s capital, young women huddle around a computer, discussing a coding issue. Many of them make the daily trip to Dhaka on the shiny new metro rail while scouring their smartphones for the latest on social media. For decades, political battles in Bangladesh have been fought on the streets, often with violence, by parties led by two powerful women. But there are signs of a generational change as the country of 169 million heads into another general election on Sunday.     Acrimony has flared once again ahead of the voting, and the opposition, led by former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia, has boycotted the elections. But millions of young voters are seeking a different narrative. A burgeoning technology industry, lively e-commerce and a growing public digital infrastructure are helping one of South Asia’s fastest growing economies capitalise on a tech-savvy workforce that is demanding change from politicians. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina is trying to woo first-time voters with her government’s Digital Bangladesh project, promising a “smart Bangladesh” by 2041 and 15 million new jobs for young people by 2030. In an address at a large election rally outside Dhaka on Saturday, Hasina asked young voters for their support, “so that the advancement of Bangladesh continues”. Some are listening. Shahrima Tanjin Arni, 26, who teaches law at Dhaka University, called Hasina a bold leader with a vision for a digital future. “She holds the values of the past, but at the same time, she has a progressive thinking in her progressive heart, which is not very common in Bangladeshi societies,” Arni said. The previous two general elections were marred by allegations of vote rigging and intimidation, which authorities denied. Hasina is seeking a fourth consecutive term and has pledged free and fair elections. But her critics have accused her of undermining the process for inclusive elections and suppressing the opposition, which Hasina blamed for violence.    Younger voters have said they want a break from the highly polarised political culture and concerns over democratic rights. “My desire is that … people of Bangladesh will freely exercise their voting right, their freedom of speech will be ensured and the justice system will work independently,” said Abdur Rahim Rony, a student at Dhaka University. “I also wish that no political party or the government will interfere with the constitutional institutions.” One-fourth of the country’s population is in the 15-29 age group, according to the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics. Almost one-third of the country’s 119.1 million registered voters are between 18 and 30. An October survey conducted online by the Bangladesh Citizen’s Platform for SDGs, or sustainable development goals, found that 69 percent of people aged 18 to 35 in Bangladesh consider corruption and nepotism as the main obstacles to development as the country sheds its least-developed economic status and grows into a middle-income developing country. “We don’t want any chaos on streets or violence. When I will finish my study, I wish to do a job or start my own business peacefully,” said 20-year-old Raul Tamjid Rahman, a first-time voter and computer science student at Brac University in Dhaka. “It’s a call from our generation to our politicians and policymakers.” The telecommunications boom in Bangladesh began in 1997 when Hasina issued free licenses to three operators to run the mobile phone sector. It was a key chance for global companies to invest in one of the world’s most densely populated countries. “The expansion of digital economy is a miracle that is bringing changes to the economic landscape with young people at the helm,” said Abu Saeed Khan, a senior policy fellow at the Sri Lanka-based think tank LIRNEasia. According to the Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission, the country now has close to 127 million internet users with about 114 million mobile internet subscribers. The government has spent millions of dollars to turn a network of 8,500 rural post offices into e-centres for local communities. New startups include some funded by Silicon Valley investors, and mobile money transfers have become common. Most of Bangladesh’s 4 million garment workers, a majority of them women, use SMS-based money transfer apps to help their families in rural areas. But inflation and dwindling foreign currency reserves still challenge Bangladesh’s economy. The country sought a $4.5bn loan from the International Monetary Fund in 2022 to safeguard its finances. The government is optimistic, however, that the economy, which grew from $8.75bn in 1971 to $460bn in 2022, will soon be worth half a trillion dollars. “Mobile voice and mobile video both have become the oxygen of [the] economy, as simple as that,” Khan said. The expansion of digital infrastructure has come with concerns over a contentious 2018 Digital Security Act and its recent replacement, the Cyber Security Act. The government said they are needed to fight misinformation, hacking and attempts to undermine people’s rights. Critics and rights activists said the previous law was misused by the government to suppress dissent and freedom of speech. Critics said the new cybersecurity law will change little from the earlier legislation. In March, a journalist for a leading newspaper was arrested under the law on charges of spreading false news. TIM Nurul Kabir, executive director of the Foreign Investors’ Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said that despite challenges, Bangladesh’s digital development is attracting young people. “This is the new generation who are coming ahead with innovations,” he said. “For a developed Bangladesh, these young people, these digital dreamers, are the backbone. Women are also increasingly joining that future journey.” Tech entrepreneur Achia Nila is one of them. “Technology is super important in my daily life. It fits into everything I do,” Nila said, adding that it helps to connect with clients and the international market. Ahead of Sunday’s elections, Nila called on political parties not to fight and instead focus on working together to further develop Bangladesh. Many young people feel frustrated with corruption and bureaucracy, she said, and warned that they may prefer to migrate to other countries because of better opportunities.",2024,1
https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2024/1/4/bangladesh-elections-mark-a-pro-china-tipping-point-in-south-asia,1/4/2024,"The year 2024 will witness key elections to choose democratic governments across the world, and the season begins with the Bangladesh election on January 7. Altogether, 29 political parties, including the governing Awami League (AL) and a faction of the opposition Jatiya Party, will fight the elections. With almost all the opposition parties led by the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) and the Jamaat-e-Islami (Jamaat) sitting out, the return of AL to power for a fourth term is a fait accompli. Bangladesh’s general elections have always drawn international attention. But this time round, certain geopolitical issues at play have pushed the level a few notches up. Till the opposition parties were in the race, countries like the United States and India, and blocs like the European Union, resorted to rhetoric, administrative action and backroom diplomacy to pressure the AL government into ensuring the elections appear to be free and fair.     This was counterbalanced by China and Russia, who told others — read the US — not to meddle in Bangladesh’s internal matters. Such a polarisation of world powers reveals the geopolitics at play in South Asia. It matters to these countries as to who rules Bangladesh. It is about who gains out of a status quo versus who is looking at potential gains if AL is voted out of power. By late 2021, the US had already made up its mind. In a press statement on December 10 that year, Secretary of State Antony Blinken imposed sanctions on two Bangladeshi security officials, Benazir Ahmed and Miftah Uddin Ahmed, for alleged extrajudicial killings, making them and their immediate family members ineligible for entry into the US. The Department of the Treasury also designated Bangladesh’s elite Rapid Action Battalion (RAB), Benazir Ahmed and five other officials under the Global Magnitsky Sanctions Program in connection with serious human rights abuse. In May 2023, the US government enacted a visa policy which denied visas to those engaged in undermining the “democratic election process”. In September 2023, the US announced that it was taking steps to implement the new visa policy. On November 13, 2023, US Assistant Secretary of State for South and Central Asian Affairs Donald Lu wrote to all three major parties – the AL, BNP and the Jatiya Party – calling for “dialogue without preconditions”. The beaming pictures of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and US President Joe Biden taken at the September G20 Summit in New Delhi do not appear to have translated into a more benign US policy over the AL-affiliated Bangladeshi government. In the run-up to prior elections, it was customary for the AL and the BNP to elicit support from India and other leading world powers, and this time was no exception. During its visit to New Delhi in August 2023, a five-member AL delegation, led by Agriculture Minister Mohammad Abdur Razzaque, met senior Indian ministers and leaders of the governing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and advocated that re-election of the AL was essential to ensure stability in the South Asian region. The AL’s talking points were familiar: a combination of fear-mongering over the BNP-Jamaat combine’s political Islamist tilt and reassurance that Dhaka would not ignore New Delhi’s sensitivities about Beijing; that China was more of a development partner, not a strategic partner; that Bangladesh has not forgotten the antagonistic role China and the US played against the country’s liberation struggle in 1971, and how India was the friend that truly helped the country gain independence. Compared with the US and its Western allies, China and India have shown more restraint in their reaction to the Bangladesh elections. While China has stated that it will back the Bangladeshi government against external interference, India believes that putting “too much” pressure would strengthen hardline forces in Bangladesh’s opposition parties. The Chinese have identified opportunities in retaining the AL government. Since 2010, China’s influence has been growing in the decision-making architecture of both Bangladesh and the AL at various levels. Beijing has strong strategic compulsions to turn Bangladesh into a state heavily dependent on it, like Myanmar and Cambodia. Doing so will ensure easier Chinese access to Indian Ocean sea lanes, bypassing the Malacca Strait via the China-Myanmar Economic Corridor (CMEC) connecting Yunnan province to the seaport city of Kyaukpyu in Myanmar’s Rakhine state. Geographically, the Ganga-Padma-Brahmaputra delta hosts the shortest land route to access the sea lanes from mainland China. That was the British calculation when they set up Calcutta (now known as Kolkata), which was then part of undivided Bengal, as their transshipment point to support the East India Company’s opium and tea trade with China. As things stand, AL in power will ensure a predictable, stable and favourable political climate to protect and promote China’s large infrastructure investments in Bangladesh. AL’s metamorphosis from a mass-based party of middle-class, secular, pro-Indian leaders, wedded to the spirit of the 1971 liberation struggle, to a party run by China-backed oligarchs – some with dubious credentials – is cause for concern both in New Delhi and Washington. Take Hasina’s top adviser, Salman Rahman, who critics claim effectively runs the government. Rahman’s family owns Beximco, one of Asia’s largest textile firms, which has significant business deals with China; or Zunaid Ahmed Palak, lawyer and minister of state for information and communication technology, who has faced accusations of being soft on Chinese companies in his role. It is not that the AL is the only governing party being driven by oligarchic interests. In neighbouring India, for instance, oligarchs close to Prime Minister Narendra Modi also push their interests, cloaked in the garb of national interests, shaping and driving domestic and foreign policies. Geopolitical issues like transborder infrastructure, disaster and pandemic response and wars provide platforms that put invisible men in grey suits on the same page as they parse out territories for commercial exploitation transcending borders. With AL set to retain its control over Bangladesh, the US effort to disrupt this metamorphosis by using human rights as a diplomatic weapon appears to have failed. To put it more bluntly, the outcome of the elections marks the tipping point at which Bangladesh buckles into China’s Belt and Road Initiative more firmly than the US-backed Indo-Pacific efforts to counter Beijing. With street violence and demonstrations on the rise, this is easier said than done. Like many other South Asian and Indian Ocean Rim Association countries, Bangladesh may not be in a position to manage the shift when China transitions from a “development partner” to a “strategic partner”. What happens after the January 7 elections is as important as the vote itself – for Bangladesh, the region, and the world’s big powers.

https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/4/bangladesh-holding-sham-election-exiled-opposition-leader-tarique-rahman,1/4/2024,"Bangladesh’s election will be a “sham” designed to cement Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina’s rule, says exiled opposition leader Tarique Rahman, defending his party’s boycott of Sunday’s vote. Rahman is heir to one of the country’s two main political dynasties – the other led by Hasina – and has helmed its largest opposition party since the 2018 jailing of his mother, two-time Prime Minister Khaleda Zia.     Six years ago, he was convicted in absentia of masterminding a deadly grenade attack on a campaign rally for Hasina and sentenced to life imprisonment. Rahman insists the charge is fabricated. His Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) staged a months-long protest campaign last year demanding the prime minister’s resignation that saw at least 11 people killed and thousands of its supporters arrested. In his interview with the AFP news agency published on Thursday, Rahman, 56, said it would be inappropriate to have his party participate in a vote with a “predetermined” outcome. “Bangladesh is approaching another sham election,” he said by email from London, where he has lived since 2008. “Participating in an election under Hasina, against the aspirations of the Bangladeshi people, would undermine the sacrifices of those who fought, shed blood and gave their lives for democracy.”    Rahman said the odds against the BNP and dozens of other parties which joined the boycott had been overwhelmingly stacked against them by the governing Awami League. He accused it of fielding “dummy” opposition candidates aligned with the governing party to give the election a patina of legitimacy. This would create “an impression of competition even though all results are predetermined”, he said. He also claimed the Awami League was attempting to drive up turnout by threatening to withhold government benefits from those who did not vote for its candidates. The United States, which sanctioned Bangladeshi security forces in 2021 over allegations of rights abuses, and other countries have also voiced their concerns about the conduct of this week’s vote. Hasina, in power since 2009, has repeatedly assured that the election would be credible after observers said the previous polls won by her party – in 2014 and 2018 – were marred by irregularities. “Go to the polling stations and cast votes in the morning to show the world that we know how to hold the election in a free and fair manner,” she told a campaign rally on Saturday. Rahman and Hasina’s families have ruled the world’s eighth-most populous nation for all but 12 years since 1971. Rahman’s father, Ziaur Rahman, a former army chief, took the reins of the country after the assassination of Hasina’s father, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, serving as president until his assassination in 1981. His mother, Zia, once teamed up with Hasina to restore democracy after a period of military rule, before the two became bitter adversaries as they competed for political power since the 1990s. Rahman has kept a low profile in London since leaving his country shortly before Hasina took power. He is rarely seen in public except at weddings of prominent members of the Bangladeshi diaspora or events marking national holidays. But with Zia jailed for corruption in 2018 and now confined to a Dhaka hospital in deteriorating health, Rahman has led the South Asian country’s largest opposition party in her stead, speaking daily with cadres through video and phone conferences. Last year, the BNP mounted huge rallies, industrial strikes, and road blockades, bringing the capital to a standstill. The campaign demanded Hasina resign and appoint a neutral caretaker government to oversee the election, an earlier convention in Bangladeshi politics that her government had abolished. One rally in October ended in bloodshed and the BNP said about 25,000 opposition activists had been arrested in the ensuing crackdown. The government puts the figure at 11,000. Hasina has accused Rahman of orchestrating violence that accompanied the protest campaign and raised the prospect of banning the BNP after the vote. “We will not allow him to give orders from London to harm and kill people,” she said on Saturday. Rahman denied accusations that his party was responsible for a spate of arson attacks during the protests, which he described as a pretext for the government’s crackdown. But his political career has long been under a cloud. A leaked US embassy cable from 2008 calls him a “notorious and widely feared … symbol of kleptocratic government” who had “flagrantly” demanded bribes in return for procurement decisions and political appointments. He was frequently accused of corruption during his mother’s last premiership and was convicted in exile. He maintains his innocence. Rahman was also convicted while abroad of organising a 2004 grenade attack on a political rally that injured Hasina and killed at least 20 people. He insists the verdict was politically motivated and accused Hasina of rewarding the police officer who led the investigation against him with a parliamentary nomination for this week’s election. “I am being targeted in a brutal and blatant manner,” he said. “Even after 15 years of power, this regime has failed to produce [any] single genuine evidence.”   ",2024,1
https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/3/dummy-candidates-coerced-voting-inside-bangladeshs-election-charade,1/3/2024,"Dhaka, Bangladesh – Hasanul Islam Ador, an elected representative in a rural area in southern Bangladesh’s Cox’s Bazar district, was taken aback when a group of officials in plain clothes barged into his home last week. Ador said the officers threatened him, saying he should stop campaigning for Zafar Alam, an independent candidate for the national election to be held on Sunday.     Alam is a current member of parliament representing Cox’s Bazar for the ruling Awami League (AL) party, led by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. When Alam failed to secure his party’s nomination for this year’s election, he was asked by the party leadership to run as an independent contender – one of what analysts and critics say are hundreds of so-called “dummy” candidates propped by the party to make the election look free and fair. Hasina, 76, has been in power for 15 straight years – the longest-serving leader in Bangladesh’s history. Her tenure has been marked by allegations of authoritarian rule, targeting of the opposition, the suppression of people’s rights, and large-scale vote rigging in elections held to keep her in power. As she seeks a record fourth term in Sunday’s vote, the main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), led by ailing former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia, has decided to boycott the vote, as it did in 2014. Zia, 78, was jailed for more than two years over corruption charges and was moved to house arrest over health concerns in 2020. She denies the allegation, saying her conviction was politically motivated. The BNP says it does not have any confidence in Hasina presiding over a free and fair election. It demanded Hasina step down to make way for a caretaker government to organise the vote. But the demand was met with a severe government crackdown, which saw tens of thousands of BNP members arrested and at least 11 of them killed by security forces during street protests, raising concerns over valid elections in the garments hub of the world. In September, the United States, the top buyer of Bangladeshi garments, said it was imposing a visa ban on the country’s officials who undermine the democratic election process. Two months later, Human Rights Watch condemned the arrests of opposition members and said “the government’s autocratic crackdown will jeopardise future economic cooperation” with other countries.    Since the opposition’s boycott call, Hasina’s party had been scrambling to field independent – or “dummy” – candidates to make the election look fair. The “competitive make-up”, as analysts call the move, saw the Awami League fielding candidates like Alam in the fray, but at the same time, ensuring the ballot does not throw up any surprises for the party. To ensure the results are in favour of the ruling party, the government is allegedly using law enforcement machinery and intelligence agencies to intimidate and threaten independent candidates. “The people who barged into my home were from an intelligence agency,” Ador told Al Jazeera. “They came to my house and threatened me to stop campaigning for Zafar Alam and seek votes for a particular candidate.” Ador and more than a dozen other local representatives in Alam’s constituency wrote a letter to the Bangladesh Election Commission, saying “an intelligence agency had put immense pressure and threatened them” to work for an Awami League candidate. The commission acknowledged receiving such a letter to Al Jazeera, with election officials saying they were “seriously looking into the complaint”. Without the main political opposition contesting, there is little uncertainty as to what the results of the Sunday vote will be. “This election is a charade,” prominent Bangladeshi rights activist Shahidul Alam told Al Jazeera. “It’s a mockery of our democracy – whatever is left of it.”    The BNP has not only boycotted the election but has also announced a non-cooperation movement, asking people not to vote on Sunday. As a result, the ruling Awami League’s main concern at the moment is to ensure a “reasonable” voter turnout, according to its official Bahauddin Nasim. To do that, the party has allegedly resorted to “undue” measures. In many constituencies, members of the ruling party have been accused of threatening to strip people of the government’s social benefits schemes if they fail to appear in polling booths on election day. Nearly 13 million people, belonging to the most vulnerable groups, receive direct social benefits from the government, according to the finance ministry’s data. Moreover, getting on the government list of beneficiaries is a process involving 473 elected officials, nearly all of them belonging to the Awami League. Videos, unverified by Al Jazeera, are viral on Bangladeshi social media, purportedly showing ruling party officials threatening the voters. Rumeen Farhana, the BNP’s international affairs secretary, told Al Jazeera that participating in an election, knowing it will be rigged, was “suicidal and a betrayal to the thousands who were hurt, detained, tortured, or killed for democracy and free speech”. “People of this country will remember this election as the most absurd and illegitimate one in its history,” she said. Michael Kugelman, director of the South Asia Institute at the Wilson Center in the United States, said the BNP boycott does the Awami League a “big favour by making it harder for Western countries to conclude that the election is fraudulent”. “If the Awami League wins 95 percent of the vote, one can’t accuse the party of stealing votes because it will essentially be running against itself,” Kugelman told Al Jazeera. He said the pattern of events leading to the BNP’s decision to boycott should be of concern to the West. “Arrests, jailings, a broader crackdown on dissent, and especially the Awami League’s refusal to release top BNP leaders from jail as the election drew closer – all of this will shape the thinking of Washington and other capitals post-election,” he said.    Mohammad A Arafat, Awami League candidate from capital Dhaka, said he was “baffled by the notion that the winner of this election will not get legitimacy from the Western countries”. “We did whatever we could. We strengthened our Election Commission and created a level playing field for all political parties. If BNP didn’t want to join, it’s their choice. Many parties have taken part in the election,” he told Al Jazeera. Ali Riaz, distinguished professor of politics and government at the Illinois State University in the US, thinks the BNP’s absence from the vote was always the most preferred option for the Awami League. “Forcing the main opposition out of the election process is a strategy autocrats around the world tend to prefer,” he told Al Jazeera. Riaz said the upcoming vote on Sunday does not meet the “basic standard of an election”. “The entire exercise looks like a stage-managed show to provide a veneer of legal legitimacy which is otherwise just dividing the parliamentary seats among allies,” he said. “I don’t think the winner will gain legitimacy from the Western countries.” Kugelman, however, said he did not expect the Western capitals to cut ties with Dhaka. “That would be rash, not to mention imprudent, especially given the close commercial ties they have with Bangladesh and the perceived strategic importance of Bangladesh in the context of the power competition in the Indo-Pacific,” he said. “But I do think if Washington and other Western capitals conclude the election isn’t credible – and it’s hard to assess it as credible when the main opposition party sits it out – there is a chance that they could review future relations with Dhaka, with downgrading of ties a possibility.”",2024,1
https://www.aljazeera.com/sports/2024/1/2/bangladesh-cricket-star-shakib-al-hasans-election-run-divides-hometown,1/2/2024,"Dhaka, Bangladesh – In Magura, a sleepy town in southwest Bangladesh, about 168km (104 miles) from capital Dhaka, more than a thousand people are gathered outside a circular-shaped auditorium. The crisp winter air barely cut short their enthusiasm as they waited for Shakib Al Hasan – their “boy from the hometown” and arguably the biggest sporting icon in the South Asian nation of some 170 million people.     Hasan arrived in a swanky SUV, waved his hand like a seasoned politician, and quickly went inside the auditorium where again a couple of hundred people were waiting for him as he appeared for an interview with a popular YouTuber and talk show host, Rafsan Sabab. The event was part of a PR campaign ahead of the national election in Bangladesh, to be held on January 7, in which Hasan, still an active player in the national cricket team, is contesting from his hometown constituency for the incumbent Awami League (AL) party. As the interview began, Sabab asked, with a smile: “Every district of Bangladesh has its own speciality, be it food, garment or a monument. Here in Magura, when I ask anyone about its speciality, they unanimously say: Shakib Al Hasan.” “Yes, I would have said the same,” Hasan wryly replied. Sabab laughed, so did the audience. But that cheeky reply perhaps best portrays the 36-year-old cricketer, known for his aggressive style both on and off the ground. That he is often called the best ever athlete Bangladesh has produced also helps. Hasan, currently the captain of Bangladesh’s one-day team, is ranked the number one all-rounder by the International Cricket Council in two of the three formats of the game simultaneously – one-day internationals (ODIs) and Twenty20 – and is ranked third in Test matches. It is often said that cricket and cinema are the twin obsessions of people in South Asia, with some cricketers turning into superstars and adored by millions of fans. Some cricketers used their popularity to foray into politics, the former Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan being the best example. For Hasan, however, the situation is a bit complicated. In October, Bangladesh’s opposition parties announced a boycott of the election after Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina refused to cede power to a caretaker government to hold the vote. Hasina, ruling with an iron fist for 15 straight years, is seeking a fourth term. Thousands of opposition activists, mainly from the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), have either been arrested or forced into hiding following a government crackdown since October, raising concerns about the legitimacy of the January 7 election. Rights groups Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch have also warned the crackdown on the opposition is aimed at subduing those against the government ahead of the vote. The government denies the charge, accusing the BNP of trying to sabotage the polls. On Tuesday, the opposition parties began a new three-day campaign, asking people not to go to the polling centres, while the ruling party continued its poll campaign.    The manner in which the election is being held has angered many in the country. Hasan, known as the “bad boy” of Bangladeshi cricket for a series of controversies on the field, isn’t immune to the criticism, as he seeks a seat in the country’s parliament from Magura. “You call it an election?” asked Ali Ahmed, a prominent BNP politician in Hasan’s hometown. “It’s a selection. Declare Hasan the member of parliament now and save us all the embarrassment.” Ahmed’s frustration was echoed by many others in Magura Al Jazeera talked to. While the town is not an opposition stronghold, years of an allegedly authoritarian regime and inflation have strengthened the anti-incumbency sentiments among the voters. Mohammad Yusuf Ali, a confectionary shop owner, told Al Jazeera the Awami League party had robbed people of the festivity of a national election. “We are being stripped of our voting rights. The last two elections were a farce. The upcoming one is even more so. Everyone here knows that Shakib [Al Hasan] will be the MP as he has no opponent. Is there any glory in scoring goals on an empty field?” he said. “Besides, I don’t think he would have won it if there was a proper election. Shakib is no longer popular here.” Hasan is undoubtedly the most famous person to ever hail from Magura, politician Ahmed said. He said the local people had been taking immense pride in the fact that the cricketer put the name of the small town on the world map by being one of the finest players the game has produced. “In tea stalls, restaurants and markets, people used to turn on the TV and sit together whenever he played,” he said. “But he is as disconnected a person as could be from his hometown people. He is arrogant, snobbish and ill-mannered. He doesn’t have the capacity to hold any political office. And by taking part in this election, he has probably lost the last bit of his popularity.” Hasan’s supporters disagree. Mehedi Hasan Ujjal, Hasan’s cousin and one of his campaign managers, claimed people are embracing him with open arms. “Just look at the crowd Shakib draws wherever he goes. The gathering and cheering of these people speak to how popular he is,” Ujjal told Al Jazeera. Wearing a kurta and black waistcoat, a garment worn by Awami League politicians, the cricket star has been campaigning in cramped markets and households. On one occasion, he was seen kneeling in a field to embrace a homeless man. The video went viral on social media. “I am a sportsman. It doesn’t matter if I become a politician. I will come here to play cricket with you many times in the next five years. I will be there for you in your thick and thin,” he said in an address at a local school. “The young people of Magura love him,” Noyon Khan, a pharmacy owner, told Al Jazeera, “They are very happy to see Shakib as our MP. Some people in the area hate him out of jealousy because he is rich and successful. But they are very few.” Nazmul Aberdeen Fahim, veteran cricket coach whom Hasan once called his mentor, told Al Jazeera that people “misunderstand” the cricketer. “They think he is unapproachable. That’s not true. He is actually very down to earth.” Fahim said Hasan has been able to break the mould of an “arrogant” star cricketer and has turned into a skilled communicator. “He had it in him. You see, cricketers are advised to stay away from the public to concentrate on their performances. That doesn’t mean they can’t run public offices well. In fact, they can read the psyche of the common people better than most others,” he said. Despite multiple attempts, Hasan refused to talk to Al Jazeera, saying he did not want to give any “interview to a foreign media”. Over a brief phone call, he however said it was “the right time to enter into politics” for him. Journalist and political analyst Rezaul Karim Rony said Hasan perhaps is the best “representative candidate” of Hasina’s Awami League party. “Arrogance, ignorance, lies, and not giving a damn to common people’s desires and demands – these are the hallmarks of Awami politics in the last decade. Shakib is a perfect embodiment of that.” Terming the upcoming election as a “massive joke”, Rony said: “If you know the results before the election, it’s not exactly an election. It’s so disheartening to see sports icons and celebrities joining and promoting this charade.”   ",2024,1
https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/1/nobel-laureate-muhammad-yunus-convicted-in-bangladesh-labour-law-case,1/1/2024,"Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus has been convicted of violating Bangladesh’s labour laws in a case decried by his supporters as politically motivated. “Professor Yunus and three of his Grameen Telecom colleagues were convicted under labour laws and sentenced to six months in simple imprisonment,” lead prosecutor Khurshid Alam Khan told the AFP news agency on Monday.     He added that all four were immediately granted bail pending appeals. Yunus, 83, is credited with lifting millions out of poverty with his pioneering microfinance bank but has earned the enmity of longtime Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, who has accused him of “sucking blood” from the poor. Hasina has made several scathing verbal attacks against the internationally respected 2006 Nobel Peace Prize winner, who was once seen as a political rival. Yunus and three colleagues from Grameen Telecom, one of the firms he founded, were accused of violating labour laws when they failed to create a workers’ welfare fund in the company. All four deny the charges. “This verdict is unprecedented,” Abdullah Al Mamun, a lawyer for Yunus, told AFP. “We did not get justice.” Yunus is facing more than 100 other charges over labour law violations and alleged corruption. He told reporters after one of the hearings last month that he had not profited from any of the more than 50 social business firms he had set up in Bangladesh. “They were not for my personal benefit,” Yunus said. Another of his lawyers, Khaja Tanvir, told AFP that the case was “meritless, false and ill-motivated”. “The sole aim of the case is to harass and humiliate him in front of the world,” he said. Irene Khan, former chief of Amnesty International now working as a United Nations special rapporteur who was present at Monday’s verdict, told AFP the conviction was “a travesty of justice”. “A social activist and Nobel laureate who brought honour and pride to the country is being persecuted on frivolous grounds,” she said. In August, 160 global figures, including former US President Barack Obama and ex-UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, published a joint letter denouncing the “continuous judicial harassment” of Yunus. The signatories, including more than 100 of his fellow Nobel laureates, said they feared for “his safety and freedom”. Critics accuse Bangladeshi courts of rubber-stamping decisions made by Hasina’s government, which is all but certain to win another term in power next week at elections boycotted by the opposition. Her administration has been increasingly firm in its crackdown on political dissent, and Yunus’s popularity among the Bangladeshi public has for years earmarked him as a potential rival. Amnesty accused the government of “weaponising labour laws” when Yunus went to trial in September and called for an immediate end to his “harassment”. Criminal proceedings against Yunus were “a form of political retaliation for his work and dissent”, it said.",2024,1
