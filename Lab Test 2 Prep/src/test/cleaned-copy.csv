"The Bangladesh Army and the government are working hand in hand to safeguard the country's interests and sovereignty, and there is no confrontation or discord between them. Senior officers of the Army Headquarters made the remarks while addressing reporters at a press conference at the Officers' Mess in Dhaka Cantonment today. Brig Gen Md Nazim-ud-Daula, director of the Military Operations Directorate (MOD) of the Army, said, ""This is our country. Its welfare and sovereignty are deeply connected to all of us. If we want to keep this country safe, we have to do it ourselves. And if anything goes wrong, we are equally responsible for that too."" Responding to a journalist's question about the ""humanitarian corridor"", he urged the media not to misrepresent the ongoing discussions regarding the government-military relationship. ""I don't believe this issue has reached a point to warrant such criticism or speculation. The government and the Bangladesh Army are working in close coordination and complementing each other. We follow the government's directives. There is no reason to interpret it otherwise,"" he said. Referring to recent debates in social media, Nazim said, ""Sometimes, even in families, there can be misunderstandings. Similarly, different stakeholders may express varying opinions in the course of running a country. But that does not mean there's division or conflict. Nothing of that sort has happened."" He reiterated that the military has always worked with the government and will continue to do so in the future. ""Let us not overcomplicate things. The government and the army are not at odds. We are working together, and I firmly believe we will continue to do so even more effectively in the days ahead."" Addressing the issue of the ""humanitarian corridor"" raised in some media reports, Nazim clarified, ""When I spoke about the Bangladesh-Myanmar border issue and the activities of ARSA, I never used the term 'corridor.' That is a separate issue. The movement of armed groups at the border has no connection to any corridor matter."" Col Md Shafiqul Islam, Col Staff of the MOD, echoed the sentiment. In reply to reporters' query about the army's stand on corridor, he said, ""The 'corridor' is a sensitive issue. Let me be clear—Bangladesh Army will never be involved in any action that may compromise national security."" Responding to rumours circulating on social media about the army taking power, Col Shafiqul said unequivocally, ""There has been no such discussion within the army. We have no intention, no interest, and no information to suggest anything of that sort."" Both officers stressed the military's ongoing commitment to working for the people of Bangladesh. ""We have always worked unitedly for the country's security and will continue doing so with full dedication,"" Shafiqul said. When asked about a media report claiming that the Kuki-Chin National Front (KNF) had ordered 3,000 uniforms from a local garment factory, Nazim said the report appeared credible and was being investigated. ""We've already seen weapons used by KNF in the Chittagong Hill Tracts, resulting in casualties among our troops,"" he said. ""We're trying to verify for whom the uniforms were made. The division is actively looking into it. We are not taking this lightly—it concerns national security,"" he added. He clarified that while KNF is a Bawm-based group, others might be joining them. ""The total Bawm population is around 12,000, including women and children. So, determining whether these uniforms were made for KNF is part of our ongoing inquiry."" Responding to concerns of compromised borders to groups like ARSA or JSS, Brig Gen Nazim firmly said, ""Absolutely not. We will never compromise our sovereignty. This is our country, and we will protect it at any cost."" Regarding ARSA's armed movement near the border, he described the Bangladesh–Myanmar border as ""extremely sensitive"", with the Arakan Army controlling most of Rakhine State. ""In such a power vacuum, movements of armed groups are not unexpected—but we're not turning a blind eye. BGB (Border Guard Bangladesh) is on high alert, with army support, to ensure no threat breaches our sovereignty,"" he said. Asked whether Lalmonirhat Airport was being activated for Chinese use—given China's proposal to build a hospital in Rangpur—Nazim dismissed any such speculation. ""The airport is being revived to support national needs, including the Aerospace University. I have no information about Chinese involvement. Rest assured, no foreign entity will be allowed to operate in a way that harms our security or national interest."" On reports of Indian authorities pushing undocumented individuals across the border, he said, ""Push-ins are unacceptable. BGB is handling it efficiently, and if needed, the army will step in under government instruction."" ""For now, BGB is managing well, within international protocols,"" he added. At the beginning of the brief, Col Shafiqul shared that over the past 40 days, the army recovered 241 illegal firearms and 709 rounds of ammunition. Since August, a total of 961 illegal firearms and 285,761 rounds of ammunition have been seized. He added that in the last month alone, 1,969 individuals linked to crimes were arrested, including listed criminals, abductors, smugglers, fraudsters, extortionists, and muggers. As part of the anti-narcotics drive, 487 drug dealers were arrested in the last 40 days, and 4,400 since August. A large amount of illegal substances such as yaba, phensedyl, cannabis, and illicit liquor was also seized. Ahead of Eid-ul-Azha, the army conducted a two-week special traffic operation to ensure safe and smooth travel. They also took steps to prevent extortion and ensure public safety at cattle markets through regular patrols and special drives. Following the directives of Chief of Army Staff General Waker-Uz-Zaman, soldiers are actively engaged in maintaining law and order across 62 districts—including remote riverine areas—through coordinated efforts with relevant ministries, law-enforcing agencies, local administration, other government bodies, the media, and the general public, added Col Shafiqul. সেনাসদর আরও জানিয়েছে, জাতীয়

"Secretariat employees should not assume they are irreplaceable, Hasnat Abdullah has said, warning of public backlash if the ongoing administrative reforms are disrupted. Hasnat, the chief coordinator (south) of the National Citizen Party or NCP, made the remark while speaking to journalists outside Biplob Udyan at Sholashahar Gate No 2 in Chattogram today before launching a road show towards the district's northern upazilas. Employees of the secretariat have been protesting for a third consecutive day against the approval of the Government Jobs (Amendment) Ordinance, 2025. ""During the July uprising, you wore black badges in support of Sheikh Hasina,"" Hasnat said. ""Now you are threatening not to let the offices function. But you did not question Sheikh Hasina's authority, nor did anyone resign in protest."" Hasnat said, ""If the 'fascist' Awami League regime had remained in power, you would have gone back to flattering them and resumed your work,"" he said. He warned the protesting bureaucrats, ""If you threaten this government after August 5 and stand in the way of reforms, remember — the people will find your alternative."" Hasnat asked, ""Did any secretary, bureaucrat or official resign before August 5? Even when citizens were being shot dead in the streets, did any one of you step down? But now that this government has been formed, you are creating barriers instead of cooperating."" He said it would be ""very bad"" for the country if the government was held hostage in this way. ""So I urge you to cooperate with the government and the reform process. If you have any reservations, settle them internally and move forward,"" Hasnat said. সেনাসদর আরও জানিয়েছে, জাতীয় নিরাপত্তা বিঘ্নিত হয়, সেনাবাহিনী এমন কোনো বিষয়ে সম্পৃক্ত হবে না।",2025-05-26T13:21:27Z,secretariatemployeesshouldnotassumetheyareirreplaceablehasnatabdullahhassaidwarningofpublicbacklashiftheongoingadministrativereformsaredisruptedhasnatthechiefcoordinatorsouthofthenationalcitizenpartyorncpmadetheremarkwhilespeakingtojournalistsoutsidebiplobudyanatsholashahargatenoinchattogramtodaybeforelaunchingaroadshowtowardsthedistrictisnorthernupazilasemployeesofthesecretariathavebeenprotestingforathirdconsecutivedayagainsttheapprovalofthegovernmentjobsamendmentordinanceduringthejulyuprisingyouworeblackbadgesinsupportofsheikhhasinahasnatsaidnowyouarethreateningnottolettheofficesfunctionbutyoudidnotquestionsheikhhasinaisauthoritynordidanyoneresigninprotesthasnatsaidifthefascistawamileagueregimehadremainedinpoweryouwouldhavegonebacktoflatteringthemandresumedyourworkhesaidhewarnedtheprotestingbureaucratsifyouthreatenthisgovernmentafteraugustandstandinthewayofreformsrememberethepeoplewillfindyouralternativehasnataskeddidanysecretarybureaucratorofficialresignbeforeaugustevenwhencitizenswerebeingshotdeadinthestreetsdidanyoneofyoustepdownbutnowthatthisgovernmenthasbeenformedyouarecreatingbarriersinsteadofcooperatinghesaiditwouldbeverybadforthecountryifthegovernmentwasheldhostageinthiswaysoiurgeyoutocooperatewiththegovernmentandthereformprocessifyouhaveanyreservationssettletheminternallyandmoveforwardhasnatsaideabeaeaaeabeeabeaaeabeaeabeaeaceabeeaaeabfeafeaeabeaeaceabeeaaeaeafeaaeabfeabeabeeaaaeaaealaughingeaaeabeeaaceabfeaealaughingeaaeabfeaaeabeafeabeaeaaeabeeaaceabeeabeabfeaaeaeafeaaeeaaeaeabeaaeabeaaceabfeabeafeaeabeaaeealaughingeaaaeaeaealaughingeaaeabeaaceaeaaeabeeaa
"Pep Guardiola said he cannot guarantee Manchester City will be back challenging for the Premier League title next season. City will play in the Champions League for a 15th straight season after they salvaged a disappointing campaign with a final-day, 2-0 win away to Fulham on Sunday that saw them finish third in the Premier League and seal their place among European club football's elite. But the club's first season without a trophy in eight years ended their unprecedented run of four successive English top-flight titles, with Guardiola's men finishing 13 points behind the Premier League champions Liverpool. Asked if his side would be in a position to challenge Arne Slot's side next term, Guardiola replied: ""I don't know. I never thought we would win six Premier League titles in seven years. ""But if you expect that I am going to tell you now that next season we are going to win the Premier League, you are wrong."" The Spaniard added: ""Since I have arrived at this club, we have finished with 80-plus points and this season we have finished with 71 so that is miles away from our standards. And it has happened for many reasons. ""Sport and football gives you another chance and we will look to prove ourselves. ""But we are miles away from Liverpool. That is the reality. I have a feeling next season will be better but I don't know how we will react after the Club World Cup. We will be exhausted without a holiday before next season. ""We have to rise and increase our level otherwise we will not compete to fight for the titles. But if we are fit, we will try and we will be closer."" With Kevin De Bruyne leaving City  and doubts over the future of Jack Grealish, some believes Guardiola needs to oversee a major rebuild if the club are to mount a title challenge next season. But Guardiola, who has already said he wanted to trim his squad, does not envisage a significant overhaul at the Etihad this summer. ""I don't have that feeling,"" he said. ""I have 24 players and I saw them training the other day and I said: 'Oh my gosh, how good are they?' ""New faces will come, especially in positions where we are weaker, but I don't think we need a lot. We have a good squad and I don't want a lot of players. ""But we will see. The summer is long. There will be players who realise they don't play and want to leave. But that is now not my business. I qualified for the Champions League and the rest belongs to the club."" সেনাসদর আরও জানিয়েছে, জাতীয় নিরাপত্তা বিঘ্নিত হয়, সেনাবাহিনী এমন কোনো বিষয়ে সম্পৃক্ত হবে না।",2025-05-26T13:58:20Z,pepguardiolasaidhecannotguaranteemanchestercitywillbebackchallengingforthepremierleaguetitlenextseasoncitywillplayinthechampionsleagueforathstraightseasonaftertheysalvagedadisappointingcampaignwithafinaldaywinawaytofulhamonsundaythatsawthemfinishthirdinthepremierleagueandsealtheirplaceamongeuropeanclubfootballiselitebuttheclubisfirstseasonwithoutatrophyineightyearsendedtheirunprecedentedrunoffoursuccessiveenglishtopflighttitleswithguardiolaismenfinishingpointsbehindthepremierleaguechampionsliverpoolaskedifhissidewouldbeinapositiontochallengearneslotissidenexttermguardiolareplietonguestickingoutidonotknowineverthoughtwewouldwinsixpremierleaguetitlesinsevenyearsbutifyouetonguestickingoutectthatiamgoingtotellyounowthatnextseasonwearegoingtowinthepremierleagueyouarewrongthespaniardaddetonguestickingoutsinceihavearrivedatthisclubwehavefinishedwithpluspointsandthisseasonwehavefinishedwithsothatismilesawayfromourstandardsandithashappenedformanyreasonssportandfootballgivesyouanotherchanceandwewilllooktoproveourselvesbutwearemilesawayfromliverpoolthatistherealityihaveafeelingnextseasonwillbebetterbutidonotknowhowwewillreactaftertheclubworldcupwewillbeexhaustedwithoutaholidaybeforenextseasonwehavetoriseandincreaseourlevelotherwisewewillnotcompetetofightforthetitlesbutifwearefitwewilltryandwewillbecloserwithkevindebruyneleavingcitycaanddoubtsoverthefutureofjackgrealishsomebelievesguardiolaneedstooverseeamajorrebuildiftheclubaretomountatitlechallengenextseasonbutguardiolawhohasalreadysaidhewantedtotrimhissquaddoesnotenvisageasignificantoverhaulattheetihadthissummeridonothavethatfeelinghesaidihaveplayersandisawthemtrainingtheotherdayandisaitonguestickingoutohmygoshhowgoodaretheynewfaceswillcomeespeciallyinpositionswhereweareweakerbutidonotthinkweneedalotwehaveagoodsquadandidonotwantalotofplayersbutwewillseethesummerislongtherewillbeplayerswhorealisetheydonotplayandwanttoleavebutthatisnownotmybusinessiqualifiedforthechampionsleagueandtherestbelongstotheclubeabeaeaaeabeeabeaaeabeaeabeaeaceabeeaaeabfeafeaeabeaeaceabeeaaeaeafeaaeabfeabeabeeaaaeaaealaughingeaaeabeeaaceabfeaealaughingeaaeabfeaaeabeafeabeaeaaeabeeaaceabeeabeabfeaaeaeafeaaeeaaeaeabeaaeabeaaceabfeabeafeaeabeaaeealaughingeaaaeaeaealaughingeaaeabeaaceaeaaeabeeaa
"After nearly two weeks of disruption, activities at the National Board of Revenue (NBR) resumed today as officials returned to work following government assurances to meet their demands over the new tax reform ordinance. Roisun Nesa, deputy commissioner of the NBR, said that the NBR officials started work in full swing.  The NBR Reform Unity Council, a platform of protesting NBR officials, initially began a pen-down strike on May 14, demanding repeal of the ordinance issued on May 12.  Beginning with pen down strike, officials abstained from work on Saturday and Sunday, severely affecting overseas trade-related services and revenue activities. The council withdrew the programme following a government pledge to transform the board into a ""specialised and autonomous agency"" rather than dissolving it. Despite returning to work, the protesting officials demanded the removal of the NBR chairman by May 29, citing what they described as a 'severe crisis of trust and confidence in his leadership.' At a press briefing today, the platform said it would continue its non-cooperation with the chairman until the demand is met. ""We hope that, in the larger interest of the state and the people, the government will assign full-time responsibility to an officer with knowledge, skills and practical work experience in tax-revenue policy formulation, collection, and management,"" the council said in a press release. সেনাসদর আরও জানিয়েছে, জাতীয় নিরাপত্তা বিঘ্নিত হয়, সেনাবাহিনী এমন কোনো বিষয়ে সম্পৃক্ত হবে না।",2025-05-26T07:54:34Z,afternearlytwoweeksofdisruptionactivitiesatthenationalboardofrevenuenbrresumedtodayasofficialsreturnedtoworkfollowinggovernmentassurancestomeettheirdemandsoverthenewtaxreformordinanceroisunnesadeputycommissionerofthenbrsaidthatthenbrofficialsstartedworkinfullswingcathenbrreformunitycouncilaplatformofprotestingnbrofficialsinitiallybeganapendownstrikeonmaydemandingrepealoftheordinanceissuedonmaycabeginningwithpendownstrikeofficialsabstainedfromworkonsaturdayandsundayseverelyaffectingoverseastraderelatedservicesandrevenueactivitiesthecouncilwithdrewtheprogrammefollowingagovernmentpledgetotransformtheboardintoaspecialisedandautonomousagencyratherthandissolvingitdespitereturningtoworktheprotestingofficialsdemandedtheremovalofthenbrchairmanbymaycitingwhattheydescribedasaiseverecrisisoftrustandconfidenceinhisleadershipatapressbriefingtodaytheplatformsaiditwouldcontinueitsnoncooperationwiththechairmanuntilthedemandismetwehopethatinthelargerinterestofthestateandthepeoplethegovernmentwillassignfulltimeresponsibilitytoanofficerwithknowledgeskillsandpracticalworketonguestickingouterienceintaxrevenuepolicyformulationcollectionandmanagementthecouncilsaidinacapresscareleaseeabeaeaaeabeeabeaaeabeaeabeaeaceabeeaaeabfeafeaeabeaeaceabeeaaeaeafeaaeabfeabeabeeaaaeaaealaughingeaaeabeeaaceabfeaealaughingeaaeabfeaaeabeafeabeaeaaeabeeaaceabeeabeabfeaaeaeafeaaeeaaeaeabeaaeabeaaceabfeabeafeaeabeaaeealaughingeaaaeaeaealaughingeaaeabeaaceaeaaeabeeaa
"A decade ago, I attended a conference in Delhi focused on technology-driven education. As I listened to the keynote speakers, I noticed a common thread in their presentations: most of them sounded like enthusiastic promoters of educational technology, almost like evangelists. Some seemed like representatives of multinational companies, advocating the use of specific tools and platforms. They spoke in glowing terms about how technology would transform education for the better, but their repetitive rhetoric made the audience visibly bored. Amidst this stream of tech-positivity, a chemistry professor from IIT Delhi broke the flow with a bold, contrarian view. He challenged the prevailing narrative. At first, his comments drew laughter, perhaps because they seemed outdated. But as he continued, the room quieted as his message gradually appeared to be thought-provoking. He firmly argued that using technology beyond chalk and board in classrooms was a mistake. According to him, technology was making teachers lazy and eroding their creativity. Many teachers were downloading PowerPoint slides and using them in class without preparation or explanation, resulting in students struggling to follow along. He urged educators to abandon this tech-driven approach, which he believed was leading education down the wrong path. Anything that destroys a teacher's creativity, he said, should have no place in the classroom. At the time, I partially agreed with him, based on my own classroom experiences. But like many, I moved on, caught up in the daily pressures of academic life. Recently, however, an encounter brought his words back to me with renewed clarity. One day, I visited a friend's house and found his daughter watching a lecture by a foreign professor on her mobile phone using the loudspeaker. The video ended quickly. Out of curiosity, I asked, ""Is your college closed today?"" She replied, surprised, ""No, it's open."" I then asked why she skipped class. Her answer struck a chord: ""I don't enjoy the lectures."" When I probed further, she said, ""The teacher just runs slides without any explanation. It's hard to concentrate. I feel completely disconnected in class."" Her words reminded me of that IIT professor's powerful observation: technology, if misused, can make teaching monotonous and ineffective. Students lose interest when educators rely solely on downloaded slides. It becomes harder for them to stay engaged, and over time, they drift away from learning. That professor's insights were not mere opinions—they now reflect a growing reality. Today's students are tech-savvy, but they are still human. They respond best to teachers who connect with them personally—teachers who explain face-to-face, who make classrooms feel alive. Slides and videos can never replace that connection. Education is not just about transferring information; it is about fostering understanding, inspiring curiosity, and encouraging critical thinking through interaction. I am not suggesting a complete ban on technology in the classroom. That would be impractical and counterproductive. Rather, I strongly advocate for the careful use of technology—tools that complement, not replace, human interaction. Technology should assist in teaching, not dominate it. Teachers should not become slaves to screens. Instead, they should use technology to enhance their teaching and make learning more human-centred and engaging. In recent years, the Government of Bangladesh has introduced various initiatives to promote the use of technology in education. Many schools and colleges have been equipped with digital infrastructure. But despite these efforts, no comprehensive evaluation has been conducted to assess the effectiveness of these technologies in improving educational quality. Consequently, we do not yet know whether this increased use of technology is having a truly positive impact. Moreover, as class time has become more constrained, a growing number of students are turning to private coaching centres. Despite government attempts to regulate this ""coaching industry"", these efforts have not been entirely successful. In reality, wherever there is demand, a market will emerge—that's the basic law of economics. The pressing question remains: why are students opting out of classrooms and going to coaching centres? Few have seriously investigated this fundamental issue. Until we conduct a deep analysis, we won't be able to solve the root problem. At the college level, student participation in classroom learning is visibly declining. Even those who attend class are often not mentally engaged. Some may ask, ""Aren't these students studying?"" Of course they are—but mostly through private coaching or tuition. This raises another question: are classroom teachers not teaching effectively? Or are they unable to make their lessons engaging enough for students? To answer these questions, we must think differently. In today's world, almost every student owns a smartphone and knows how to use it efficiently. Teachers, too, are now digitally equipped. If we stop seeing this reality as a weakness and instead use it as a strength, might we bring about a positive transformation in our college classrooms? This brings us to a modern and promising concept—the ""flipped classroom."" A flipped classroom turns the traditional model of instruction on its head. Instead of introducing new material in class, the teacher shares it with students beforehand via WhatsApp, Messenger, or other platforms. Students study the material at home and come to class with questions and thoughts. The classroom then becomes a lively space for discussion, clarification, and deeper engagement. This model isn't limited to printed material. Teachers can record brief video lectures and share them in advance. If these videos are interesting and aligned with the subject matter, they can boost student interest. Some teachers may even create their own YouTube channels and upload content for broader access. In addition, PowerPoint slides and other resources can be shared to support learning. These methods foster a culture of self-study and independence among students. Instead of memorising facts, they begin to understand concepts, think critically, and engage meaningfully with the material. As a result, they are more likely to participate actively in class, making the classroom a dynamic and interactive learning environment for both students and teachers. In short, the flipped classroom can be an effective way to bridge the growing gap between students and teachers in this digital age. With just a little effort, it is possible to rekindle students' interest in learning and significantly increase their classroom engagement. It's not about rejecting technology, but about using it wisely and purposefully to enrich the educational experience. Let us not forget: education is not merely about data delivery—it's about connection, communication, and transformation. A teacher's role is not just to provide information but to guide, inspire, and spark curiosity. As we move forward in this technology-driven era, let us strive to make our classrooms not silent, but vibrant—with dialogue, understanding, and mutual respect at the heart of every lesson. Dr Md.

"A recent report in this daily once again highlights how unsafe this country has become for children, particularly girls. Reports of rape cases compiled by Ain O Salish Kendra (ASK) and Bangladesh Mahila Parishad during the first quarter of this year show that the majority of the victims are aged below 18 years. ASK documented 342 reported cases, with 87.56 percent of known-age victims being children. Alarmingly, 40 victims were aged between infancy and six—too young to even grasp the horror inflicted on them. However, that does not appear to discourage the perpetrators, some of whom even carry out this heinous act in gangs. ASK data shows children also made up the majority of gang rape victims. Of the 84 reported gang rapes between January and April, 32 victims' ages were known, and 20 of them were minors. What does it say about our society—that before one protest over child rape ends, another child falls victim? Last year, an analysis published in this daily based on ASK data revealed that one rape occurred every nine hours in Bangladesh and the majority of victims are girls. For adolescent girls, the situation is even worse. The 2024 Violence Against Women Survey showed that adolescent girls, whether married or not, are the most vulnerable when it comes to both intimate partner violence and non-partner violence. These findings make one thing painfully clear: in Bangladesh, a girl's age, marital status, or social position offers no protection from abuse. In fact, child marriage only reinforces patriarchal—and in some cases, predatory—attitudes towards girls. Despite progress in education and growth in the economy, we have failed to challenge the misogynistic mindset still pervasive among some men among us. Unfortunately, attempts to introduce topics in schools that provide comprehensive mental, physical and reproductive health education along with teaching and encouraging appropriate behaviours to young people have been blocked. We have tried to address the issue of sexual violence against women with laws, which alone cannot prevent these heinous crimes. It is time the government listened to the rights bodies and took steps to break the silence regarding cases of abuse, introduced school-based safety training, improved mental health and rehabilitation services. It also needs to facilitate community engagement involving parents, teachers, and local leaders, including the religious ones, increase monitoring of cybercrimes, and address the issue of offensive contents on social media. Ultimately, we must root out misogyny from society if we hope to make Bangladesh safe for girls. Until then, our children remain vulnerable. সেনাসদর আরও জানিয়েছে, জাতীয় নিরাপত্তা বিঘ্নিত হয়, সেনাবাহিনী এমন কোনো বিষয়ে সম্পৃক্ত হবে না।",2025-05-26T06:30:00Z,arecentreportinthisdailyonceagainhighlightshowunsafethiscountryhasbecomeforchildrenparticularlygirlsreportsofrapecasescompiledbyainosalishkendraaskandbangladeshmahilaparishadduringthefirstquarterofthisyearshowthatthemajorityofthevictimsareagedbelowyearsaskdocumentedreportedcaseswithpercentofknownagevictimsbeingchildrenalarminglyvictimswereagedbetweeninfancyandsixetooyoungtoevengraspthehorrorinflictedonthemhoweverthatdoesnotappeartodiscouragetheperpetratorssomeofwhomevencarryoutthisheinousactingangsaskdatashowschildrenalsomadeupthemajorityofgangrapevictimsofthereportedgangrapesbetweenjanuaryandaprilvictimsageswereknownandofthemwereminorswhatdoesitsayaboutoursocietyethatbeforeoneprotestoverchildrapeendsanotherchildfallsvictimlastyearananalysispublishedinthisdailybasedonaskdatarevealedthatonerapeoccurredeveryninehoursinbangladeshandthemajorityofvictimsaregirlsforadolescentgirlsthesituationisevenworsetheviolenceagainstwomensurveyshowedthatadolescentgirlswhethermarriedornotarethemostvulnerablewhenitcomestobothintimatepartnerviolenceandnonpartnerviolencethesefindingsmakeonethingpainfullyclearinbangladeshagirlisagemaritalstatusorsocialpositionoffersnoprotectionfromabuseinfactchildmarriageonlyreinforcespatriarchaleandinsomecasespredatoryeattitudestowardsgirlsdespiteprogressineducationandgrowthintheeconomywehavefailedtochallengethemisogynisticmindsetstillpervasiveamongsomemenamongusunfortunatelyattemptstointroducetopicsinschoolsthatprovidecomprehensivementalphysicalandreproductivehealtheducationalongwithteachingandencouragingappropriatebehaviourstoyoungpeoplehavebeenblockedwehavetriedtoaddresstheissueofsexualviolenceagainstwomenwithlawswhichalonecannotpreventtheseheinouscrimesitistimethegovernmentlistenedtotherightsbodiesandtookstepstobreakthesilenceregardingcasesofabuseintroducedschoolbasedsafetytrainingimprovedmentalhealthandrehabilitationservicesitalsoneedstofacilitatecommunityengagementinvolvingparentsteachersandlocalleadersincludingthereligiousonesincreasemonitoringofcybercrimesandaddresstheissueofoffensivecontentsonsocialmediaultimatelywemustrootoutmisogynyfromsocietyifwehopetomakebangladeshsafeforgirlsuntilthenourchildrenremainvulnerableeabeaeaaeabeeabeaaeabeaeabeaeaceabeeaaeabfeafeaeabeaeaceabeeaaeaeafeaaeabfeabeabeeaaaeaaealaughingeaaeabeeaaceabfeaealaughingeaaeabfeaaeabeafeabeaeaaeabeeaaceabeeabeabfeaaeaeafeaaeeaaeaeabeaaeabeaaceabfeabeafeaeabeaaeealaughingeaaaeaeaealaughingeaaeabeaaceaeaaeabeeaa
"In an article titled ""How Not to Describe the Awami League"" published in this newspaper, British journalist David Bergman rightly underscores the importance of accuracy in labelling a political party—particularly when such labels carry potential legal consequences. Those familiar with Bergman's work over the years know that he has consistently taken on politically sensitive and controversial subjects, often at significant personal and professional costs. His courage and commitment to journalistic integrity deserve recognition. Bergman is correct in asserting that ""while serious criticisms of the Awami League are both valid and necessary, they must be proportionate and grounded in fact."" His analysis focuses primarily on the legal validity and appropriateness of labelling the Awami League as ""fascist"" or ""Nazi."" He argues that comparing the party to the Nazi regime trivialises the scale of Nazi atrocities and misrepresents the complexities of Bangladeshi politics.  Indeed, any historical comparison between the Nazi Party and the Awami League would be an exaggeration. The scale of violence, genocidal policies, and totalitarianism under the Nazis is unmatched. However, describing the Awami League as a ""fascist"" party—based on its trajectory and actions within the context of Bangladesh's political history—is not a distortion. On the contrary, it is a term that demands serious consideration. Let's examine what defines fascism. According to Merriam-Webster, fascism is: ""A populist political philosophy, movement, or regime (such as that of the Fascisti) that exalts nation and often race above the individual, that is associated with a centralised autocratic government headed by a dictatorial leader, and that is characterised by severe economic and social regimentation and by forcible suppression of opposition."" The Cambridge Dictionary defines it as: ""A political system based on a very powerful leader, state control, and being extremely proud of (the) country and race, and in which political opposition is not allowed.""  With the exception of racial supremacy, the Awami League—especially under Sheikh Hasina's leadership—demonstrates most of these traits. It is important to acknowledge that the Awami League of today is not the same party founded by Maulana Abdul Hamid Khan Bhashani and Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. The party that once led the struggle for independence has undergone several transformations—dissolving into BAKSAL in 1975 and re-emerging under military rule. Since Sheikh Hasina assumed leadership in 1981, the party has been fundamentally reshaped—ideologically and structurally—into a vehicle for autocratic rule. Recognising that fascism today is understood more broadly, the US-based think tank Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) identifies extreme nationalism, cult of personality, and mass mobilisation as hallmarks of fascist systems. Has the Awami League not exhibited these traits?  Bergman, like several commentators, seems to conflate a ban on the activities of the Awami League with a ban on the party itself. The official notification only restricts its activities including use of violence, which the interim government considers can influence the judicial process adversely—not the party's existence. It is akin to placing conditions on a defendant during trial to prevent interference. This distinction matters and must be preserved to avoid further confusion. Consider how dissenters have been labelled anti-national, often branded as ""Razakars"" or agents of Pakistan. The idolisation of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman—evident in the proliferation of his images, statues, and memorials—has fostered a cult of personality around the Sheikh family. The Awami League's grip on the state apparatus has allowed it to mobilise supporters and suppress opposition with unmatched efficiency. The CFR also warns that, while classical fascism is historically tied to the interwar period, its characteristics can reappear in modern political contexts. Global democratic backsliding only increases the risk of such authoritarian tendencies resurfacing. Bergman's cautious assertion that ""elements of the Awami League's conduct may well resemble certain authoritarian traits of a fascist party"" but that it is ""inaccurate to describe it as one"" is problematic. This framing can inadvertently downplay the extent of Sheikh Hasina's authoritarian control. Party officials, including the general secretary, frequently have openly acknowledged that final decisions rest solely with the party chief. Even her son, Sajeeb Wazed Joy, once admitted that Sheikh Hasina appreciates being portrayed by Western media as an authoritarian leader.  Using the four key indicators of authoritarian behaviour identified by Steven Levitsky and Daniel Ziblatt in How Democracies Die, one could argue that democracy in Bangladesh has long ceased to function. These indicators are: rejecting democratic rules of the game; denying legitimacy to political opponents; encouraging violence; and curtailing civil liberties. All four apply to Bangladesh's current political landscape. That said, Bergman's concerns about repression, including arbitrary arrests and politically motivated charges, are entirely valid. Justice demands that those responsible for violence—particularly against opposition members and student protesters—be held accountable. However, no one should be persecuted on fabricated or politically expedient charges. Bergman, like several commentators, seems to conflate a ban on the activities of the Awami League with a ban on the party itself. The official notification only restricts its activities including use of violence, which the interim government considers can influence the judicial process adversely—not the party's existence. It is akin to placing conditions on a defendant during trial to prevent interference. This distinction matters and must be preserved to avoid further confusion. In sum, describing the Awami League in precise and historically informed terms is essential for ensuring that political discourse in Bangladesh remains honest and grounded in reality.

"When Zainul Abedin left Calcutta (now Kolkata) in 1947, as India and Pakistan negotiated a partition-ridden freedom from the British Empire, he was one of the city’s most acclaimed artists.  When Zainul Abedin left Calcutta (now Kolkata) in 1947, as India and Pakistan negotiated a partition-ridden freedom from the British Empire, he was one of the city's most acclaimed artists. By the early 1940s, Abedin had become the youngest and beloved teacher at the Government School of Art. His stark sketches of hunger and death in the city's streets had captured the catastrophic, man-made Bengal famine of 1943, which was killing and displacing millions in Bengal, as the Allied army fought Japan on the eastern frontiers of the Second World War. His works fascinated artists, critics, journalists, activists, and a late-colonial public alike, who saw the very meaning of beauty and national form transformed in the artist's sharp, expressionistic realism. In January and February 1945, Abedin featured on the cover of People's War, the national organ of the Communist Party of India (CPI) (Figure 1). His famine art was introduced in this issue by the party's iconic artist-cadre, Chittaprosad, as the CPI organised the first exhibition of Abedin's works. In 1944, Abedin had also illustrated the activist-journalist Ela Sen's Darkening Days: Being a Narrative of Famine-Stricken Bengal in May 1944. When the now-renowned artist Somnath Hore, then a young novice in the early 1940s, was identified by CPI leadership, he was placed under Abedin's mentorship at the art school in 1945. By 1946, Hore would begin his dedicated career of documenting popular resistance, experimenting with socially committed modernist art, and continuing, perhaps, Abedin's very own legacy in post-Partition, independent India.  Realism was a cornerstone in Abedin's art practice, as a vision and even as a conservatism that he would hold on to, while he dedicated himself to shaping artistic taste and pedagogy as Principal of Dhaka's art institute, formed earlier, in 1948-49. Abedin's return to Dhaka, the capital of the eastern wing of a newly formed Pakistan, sprawled on both sides of India, was forced – even as he himself hailed from this former East Bengal's Mymensingh district. As Abedin, along with his fellow-artists from Calcutta – Safiuddin Amhad, Qamrul Hasan, and Anwarul Hasan – chose to leave a polarised, genocidal milieu of a communal riot-torn Calcutta, he had to confront deep professional and personal insecurity. Rebuilding artistic foundations in the new capital of Pakistan's eastern wing, Dhaka, was challenging. Abedin would go on to become a foundational figure – an artist, pedagogue and cultural bureaucrat – central to the formation of an artistic sphere in East Pakistan, active also in the federal centre in the west. It took imagination, labour, and persistent negotiations with the federal government in West Pakistan. And even as East Pakistani artists like Abedin visited and thrived in the west, the asymmetries in artistic infrastructure between the two wings remained. Partition had marked the stories of artistic modernism in the sub-continent in ways lived and felt, but often invisible to history writing. Zainul Abedin's artistic practice – from his early years as a migrant art school student in colonial Calcutta in the 1930s to his stature as Silpacharya – the most celebrated artist-pedagogue of post-liberation Bangladesh in the 1970s, carries these lived shadow-lines of 20th-century decolonisation in the sub-continent. Still more, and critically so, Abedin symbolises, along with his many other fellow artist-pedagogues across the decolonising worlds in Asia, Africa and the Middle East, this artistic legacy of shaping how freedom itself could be visualised in young nations undergoing often-turbulent postcolonial transitions. This allegorical weight that Abedin has had to shoulder – in life as much as in the afterlives of his legacy – has often also been heavy. Can we return to this heavy iconicity of a 'national artist', to draw his lines and lineages differently? As a young entrant into Calcutta's art worlds in the 1930s, Abedin, along with fellow students from the Government School of Art, sought to generate new space for artistic realism. The art school's syllabus as well as the city's art discourse had been dominated hitherto by the idyllic ""Indian-style"" wash paintings of the Bengal School, pioneered in the early-1900s by Abanindranath Tagore, and institutionalised by his followers. In the 1930s, the Bengal School was still following idealistic mythological subjects and had partly morphed into a dynamic yet still-idealistic ruralist earthiness at Kala Bhavan, the art school of the experimental 'global' university of Visva-Bharati at rural Santiniketan, established in 1919 by Rabindranath Tagore. For Abedin and his fellow realist painters like Abani Sen or Gobardhan Ash, this idealism was inadequate to capture what contemporary society and landscape itself looked like. Against all odds, they would exhibit their works, and by the late-1930s critics were noticing. Reviewing their 1936 show, for instance, the critic Jaminikanta Sen had written that such works carried a new satyabodh – a ""sensibility of truth"" and a ""new nationalism"" that could visualise the nation via the harsh ""truths of contemporary reality"", marked by industrialisation, famished villagers, and their actual living conditions. The famine pushed this realist sensibility to new extremes, as Abedin's art turned to a minimalist expressionism that transformed realism from the often-critiqued sterility of academic naturalist ""colonial"" style art, to a dynamic yet challenging form of modernist realism that questioned the very foundation of artistic truth and beauty. Abedin's famished rural refugees in Calcutta's street corners, battling crows and dogs for morsels of food were more than an index of art's social commitment or the art of the famine – they were, indeed, the aesthetics of late-imperialism and the paradoxes of anti-fascist war in imperial colonies of the Allied army itself. As Abedin, then an impoverished migrant artist himself, drew his ink sketches of hunger-ridden pavements, with dry brush and ink on cheap brown wrapping paper, walking these streets on his way to the art school, a new shape of artistic roles in the shadow of empire, was emerging. He himself probed these possibilities, as he joined the Anti-Fascist Writers' and Artists' Association, and other collectives of progressive art already in the early 1940s, steered increasingly by a cultural movement shaped by the Communist Party of India. Realism was born in the streets of Calcutta, the noted art critic of postcolonial Bangladesh, Burhanuddin Khan Jahangir would write of Abedin's famine works, in his biography of Zainul Abedin in the 1990s. Abedin's famine drawings were to stay with him all along his post-1947 career in East Pakistan, exhibited in his shows as he travelled across the world in the 1950s and 1960s, and held close as he fled an invading Pakistani army during the liberation war in 1971 that gave birth, through another genocide, to today's Bangladesh from East Pakistan. Realism was a cornerstone in Abedin's art practice, as a vision and even as a conservatism that he would hold on to, while he dedicated himself to shaping artistic taste and pedagogy as Principal of Dhaka's art institute, formed earlier, in 1948-49. Yet Abedin's realism carried many lines, as it shaped what the social – and via that, the political – could mean in art. From the 1930s itself, this sense of the social, for Abedin, was heavily mediated by rural lives – whether in his early forays into painting rural labour in 1930s Dumka, or the rural displaced in the wartime famine, or increasingly in post-independence East Pakistan, the unchanging rhythms of a rural everyday, between struggle and resilience, labour and leisure. There is in Abedin's practice, a dialogue between the rural and the social, and modernist form-making itself that would inform his pedagogy and legacy – and indeed, its allegorical weight for East Pakistan and Bangladesh that he carried as Silpacharya. This same dialogue also shapes Abedin's significance our understanding of how integrating (social) realism with modernism, and the figurative with the abstract, were critical cornerstones in the artistic imaginations of the decolonial transformations of the 1940s-80s. This has implications for pushing art historical thinking beyond the artificial oppositions between figurative and abstract art planted globally by an Americanised art discourse via the cultural politics of the Cold War. Abedin himself was a postcolonial traveller in this global cultural Cold War. By the mid-1950s, he was a highly mobile artist travelling across the USA, Europe, the Middle East, Central and East Asia, the Soviet Union, on various fellowships like the Commonwealth, the Rockefeller grants, and on commissions from the Pakistani government. In September 1951, he made his first trip to London on a Commonwealth scholarship to study art pedagogy. Abedin studied at the Slade School and exhibited across London. In 1952, he attended the UNESCO conference held during the Venice Biennale, where ideas of cultural freedom, artistic exchange, new aesthetic standards of modern art and post-1945 cultural reconstruction were being discussed. In the 1960s, Abedin was invited by the Soviet Union where he was awarded a gold medal, and later by the Arab League to visit and sketch the Palestinian guerrillas and refugees.  He was, in fact, a typical, artist-diplomat of the period of decolonisation and Cold War who would be serially invited by the United States and the Soviet Union, countries of the Eastern Bloc as well as Japan in a muted contest over the cultural imagination of the 'Third World'. Abedin's journeys marked his artistic trajectory in the styles he experimented with, though his subjects remained the same – labour, struggle, and the rural everyday. For instance, after he returned from his first spell in the UK, Europe, and Turkey between 1952-53, his style would change, though mildly and for a short span. He began experimenting in linear simplifications, breaking up the image, trying out semi-Cubistic figurations, while remaining committed to building art's foundations in a public culture. Throughout the 1950s, Abedin made conscious efforts to integrate art with the people – whether in projecting the image of the common man in art or promoting public access and participation in art-making. Over the 1960s, Abedin tied himself more to the collection and documentation of folk art, a substantial part of which formed the core of the Sonargaon museum in post-liberation Bangladesh. This was, at the same time, his self-fashioning as a patron and preserver of folk art, and also increasingly, his retreat into the identity of a pedagogue rather than that of a modernist artist. 1970 appears as a culmination of Abedin's artistic trajectory. In spring he made the scroll Nabanna, a celebration of the harvest festival where he created what can be seen as an allegory of the incipient nation – from the displacements of the 1940s, through growing rhythms of everydayness, to labour and leisure that have built the social fabric of his nation. In the summer of 1970, Abedin visited Palestinian refugee camps along the Jordan river as part of his tour across the Arab world (Figure 2). He wanted to head back, and organise another exhibition, the profits of which he intended to donate to the Palestinian cause. He was unable to return, and the works he left behind in Cairo were also lost. Returning to Dhaka in that summer, Abedin was to be overtaken by a growing political resistance at home, one that would lead to a genocidal liberation war, giving birth to Bangladesh. In November 1970 when the tidal wave in Monpura killed and ravaged millions, Abedin toured the destruction on a helicopter and returned with notes. Much later, he would paint Monpura '70 – as his wife Jahanara Abedin noted – in one sitting, with rapid movements. Monpura'70 (Figure 3) is a harking back to the famine of 1943, as much as an encounter with the immensity of death, once again in the shadow of liberation struggle. So was Nabanna at the start of 1970. The Palestinian experience sits in the middle as a radical return to art's encounter with displacement, a battle itself perhaps, with the demand of artistic form in the shadow of dehumanisation. The dialectical tension between art's formal and socio-political pulls both shines and challenges how this aesthetics of 20th century decolonisation could be understood. Abedin the artist, his epic scrolls, his persisting returns to a rebel bull or rural fragments of labour and repose stand as possibilities – to read art as archives for understanding how the historical time of 20th century decolonisation was lived, imagined, remembered, and challenged, despite the ways our individual nation-states narrate fragmented pasts.

"We are relieved that the chief adviser has not followed through on his desire to resign. All major political parties have reaffirmed their support to the chief adviser and expressed that they do not want him to step down. Thankfully, a national crisis has been averted. At the same time, we are wondering what else, other than the chief adviser's decision to resign being reversed, has been achieved. We are waiting, for instance, to hear the chief adviser and his cabinet's response regarding the issues of contention brought forward by the BNP, Jamaat-e-Islami, and NCP. BNP has said it has placed its demands, and the chief adviser has listened. But the issues have not been resolved. The party reiterated its demand for a general election to be held by December this year and the resignation of two student representatives in the advisory council as well as the CA's national security adviser. Jamaat has demanded a timeline for the election and another for reforms and trials of Awami League leaders for their alleged role in mass killings during the July uprising. Meanwhile, the NCP has demanded reconstitution of the Election Commission, local government polls before the general election, and roadmaps to July killing trials, political reforms, and plans for parliamentary and constituent assembly polls. It also added another demand: that all national and local elections during the Sheikh Hasina regime be declared ""invalid.""  Thus, we are back to square one, with no visible consensus between the government and the political parties. Meanwhile, protests and lockdowns continue. Yesterday, employees of the Bangladesh Secretariat staged demonstrations inside the office premises protesting the government's initiative to amend the Government Service Act, 2018 by introducing stricter penalties. The Dhaka South Nagar Bhaban has again been padlocked by protesters who demand BNP leader Ishraque Hossain to be sworn in as the mayor following a court verdict. The NBR is in deep crisis with disgruntled employees continuing to protest, demanding the chairman's removal and the repeal of a new ordinance that splits the tax authority. Customs clearance and business operations have been hampered due to the protests. The result has been total chaos and disruption in regular public services and businesses, as well as paralysis of the city.  But, ultimately, the interim government and its chief are responsible for maintaining stability—both within the country and within the government. It must find ways to negotiate with all the political and non-political stakeholders and come to some points of convergence. The government has identified three main priorities: election, reform, and trial (of the accused in the July uprising killings). But in order to allay all uncertainties and curb the barrage of constant protests, the interim government must provide clarity regarding an election roadmap and the reforms it is undertaking. সেনাসদর আরও জানিয়েছে, জাতীয় নিরাপত্তা বিঘ্নিত হয়, সেনাবাহিনী এমন কোনো বিষয়ে সম্পৃক্ত হবে না।",2025-05-25T14:30:00Z,wearerelievedthatthechiefadviserhasnotfollowedthroughonhisdesiretoresignallmajorpoliticalpartieshavereaffirmedtheirsupporttothechiefadviserandetonguestickingoutressedthattheydonotwanthimtostepdownthankfullyanationalcrisishasbeenavertedatthesametimewearewonderingwhatelseotherthanthechiefadviserisdecisiontoresignbeingreversedhasbeenachievedwearewaitingforinstancetohearthechiefadviserandhiscabinetisresponseregardingtheissuesofcontentionbroughtforwardbythebnpjamaateislamiandncpbnphassaidithasplaceditsdemandsandthechiefadviserhaslistenedbuttheissueshavenotbeenresolvedthepartyreiterateditsdemandforageneralelectiontobeheldbydecemberthisyearandtheresignationoftwostudentrepresentativesintheadvisorycouncilaswellasthecaisnationalsecurityadviserjamaathasdemandedatimelinefortheelectionandanotherforreformsandtrialsofawamileagueleadersfortheirallegedroleinmasskillingsduringthejulyuprisingmeanwhilethencphasdemandedreconstitutionoftheelectioncommissionlocalgovernmentpollsbeforethegeneralelectionandroadmapstojulykillingtrialspoliticalreformsandplansforparliamentaryandconstituentassemblypollsitalsoaddedanotherdemantonguestickingoutthatallnationalandlocalelectionsduringthesheikhhasinaregimebedeclaredinvalidthuswearebacktosquareonewithnovisibleconsensusbetweenthegovernmentandthepoliticalpartiesmeanwhileprotestsandlockdownscontinueyesterdayemployeesofthebangladeshsecretariatstageddemonstrationsinsidetheofficepremisesprotestingthegovernmentisinitiativetoamendthegovernmentserviceactbyintroducingstricterpenaltiesthedhakasouthnagarbhabanhasagainbeenpadlockedbyprotesterswhodemandbnpleaderishraquehossaintobesworninasthemayorfollowingacourtverdictthenbrisindeepcrisiswithdisgruntledemployeescontinuingtoprotestdemandingthechairmanisremovalandtherepealofanewordinancethatsplitsthetaxauthoritycustomsclearanceandbusinessoperationshavebeenhamperedduetotheproteststheresulthasbeentotalchaosanddisruptioninregularpublicservicesandbusinessesaswellasparalysisofthecitybutultimatelytheinterimgovernmentanditschiefareresponsibleformaintainingstabilityebothwithinthecountryandwithinthegovernmentitmustfindwaystonegotiatewithallthepoliticalandnonpoliticalstakeholdersandcometosomepointsofconvergencethegovernmenthasidentifiedthreemainprioritieselectionreformandtrialoftheaccusedinthejulyuprisingkillingsbutinordertoallayalluncertaintiesandcurbthebarrageofconstantproteststheinterimgovernmentmustprovideclarityregardinganelectionroadmapandthereformsitisundertakingeabeaeaaeabeeabeaaeabeaeabeaeaceabeeaaeabfeafeaeabeaeaceabeeaaeaeafeaaeabfeabeabeeaaaeaaealaughingeaaeabeeaaceabfeaealaughingeaaeabfeaaeabeafeabeaeaaeabeeaaceabeeabeabfeaaeaeafeaaeeaaeaeabeaaeabeaaceabfeabeafeaeabeaaeealaughingeaaaeaeaealaughingeaaeabeaaceaeaaeabeeaa
"The National Board of Revenue (NBR), Bangladesh's top tax machinery that is responsible for more than 85 percent of the country's domestic revenue, almost ground to a halt over the last few days. It faced a near paralysis over the recent NBR bifurcation ordinance. Office activities were almost halted, with protests by its employees intensifying, with the fiscal clock ticking and the budget knocking on the door. The protest erupted following the issuance of an ordinance on May 12 that legally disbanded the NBR and the Internal Resources Division (IRD), replacing them with two separate entities: Revenue Policy Division and Revenue Management Division. The disgruntled NBR employees had planned to go on a complete shutdown in all the revenue offices countrywide, including export-import assessment on sea, land and air routes, from today, but after receiving assurances from the government, they decided to put their work abstention programme on hold, according to a press release they issued last night. Framed as a long-overdue step in the modernisation of the country's tax system—driven in part by the IMF conditions—the move has run into fierce bureaucratic resistance. Two questions now loom large: i) who will pay for the NBR turmoil?; and ii) when will this deadlock end? The protest cast a shadow over the NBR's revenue goals. In the first 10 months of the 2024-25 fiscal year, the tax authority collected Tk 2.85 lakh crore, reflecting a low year-on-year growth of nearly three percent, according to provisional data. Despite lowering the revenue target for FY2025 by Tk 18,500 crore, the NBR still has to collect Tk 178,500 crore by the end of June this year to meet the Tk 463,500 crore target. If the protesters resume their work abstention, it poses a clear risk to meeting that goal. Moreover, the NBR is likely to miss its revenue target tied to the IMF's conditions, which require collecting nearly Tk 4.55 lakh crore by June this year and raising the tax-to-GDP ratio to 7.9 percent within that time frame. Typically, the final two to three months of the fiscal year are critical for the NBR, during which it collects around Tk 40,000-50,000 crore per month. This momentum has been clearly disrupted this year. However, even with essential services spared, the bulk of domestic revenue operations would be under strain if the revenue operations shut down completely. Already, over the past few days of protests, businesses saw delays in cargo release, and tax refunds were held up. New compliance drives were suspended. That means less money flowed into government coffers just as Bangladesh prepared for a challenging national budget. So, it is not the protesting officers, nor the reform architects or top bureaucrats who would feel the impact of the NBR turmoil. In essence, the fiscal burden of this administrative standoff would fall squarely on the shoulders of the citizens, who already are burdened by inflation, with the consumer price index remaining above nine percent for the past 26 months. It would be the businesses who would be unable to clear goods on time and be forced to bear mounting demurrage charges. And if export activities are disrupted, it will inevitably hurt the country's foreign currency reserves. In the long run, the credibility of Bangladesh's entire reform agenda might suffer the most. The proposed reform, backed by global lenders like the IMF and World Bank follows a sound principle: separate policy design from implementation. But the execution has been anything but inclusive. The NBR Reform Unity Council, the platform of NBR officers and employees, claims that the government bypassed the experienced revenue officers, opening the door for other government service cadres including admin cadres. Even the Revenue Reform Advisory Committee—tasked with designing the restructuring—has publicly disavowed the final ordinance. Protesters are calling not just for a rollback or repeal, but also the NBR chairman's removal and full disclosure of the advisory report. In their eyes, this is not reform. It's a hostile takeover of one of Bangladesh's most technical institutions. Fortunately, the government has issued statements assuring that it would amend the ordinance, and NBR wouldn't be dissolved before the amendment is done, which will happen only after discussion with all the stakeholders. Following that, the protesters also issued a statement announcing that they were withdrawing their work abstention programme. However, they remain firm on their core demands, which include resignation of the chairman, and they said they would continue non-cooperation with the chairman. There are no winners in a prolonged bureaucratic standoff. The protesters aren't opposing the separation itself as they want the NBR reformed, not dissolved. Their demand is to restructure it as an independent commission or division, led by officials from the revenue cadre. With the national budget proposal set to be announced on June 2, both local and foreign investors have begun expressing concern over the unfolding situation. If this crisis is allowed to fester, it risks further dysfunction within one of the country's most critical economic engines. Investors will take note. Development partners will raise eyebrows. And taxpayers will grow more cynical—possibly further weakening an already fragile tax compliance. A delegation of the protesters submitted a memorandum to the Chief Adviser's Office on Thursday to press their four-point demand, including repeal of the ordinance and removal of the NBR chairman. This crisis will only be resolved if both sides return to the table—and Chief Adviser Prof Muhammad Yunus plays a critical role in resolving the turmoil through an open dialogue. Publishing the advisory committee's report and re-engaging stakeholders in genuine consultation could help dispel suspicion and rebuild trust. Bangladesh cannot afford a broken tax system, especially now. The sooner this crisis is resolved, the less damage it will have on an already strained fiscal landscape.

"Try to lay back and think about 1990's Bangladesh, when a nation was struggling with poverty, rampant power outages, and torpid industries. In that year, Bangladesh's total industrial gross domestic product (GDP) was around $15 billion, which boomed and increased to over $115 billion by 2023—a staggering eight-fold growth. We have developed ceramics, textiles, steel, FMCG, energy, construction, and further industries. As a nation, we grew, created jobs, alleviated millions from the ruthless grip of poverty, and uplifted living standards. We rebranded ourselves from a ""basket case"" to a development marvel. We converted the ""Made in Bangladesh"" label into a legacy. But here's the uncomfortable truth: the overwhelming ecological toll we are paying for this exponential growth. Our beautiful country, nature, and ecosystem are struggling to cope; rivers are suffocating due to industrial waste, and continuously increasing passive emissions of carbon as we chase prosperity, while air pollution is shaving years off life expectancy. The most critical question is no longer about the potential for growth; rather, it is about how to achieve it. Can we industrialize without destroying ourselves? Or will the future generation look back at our actions and ask, ""Our ancestors built the economy but destroyed the land that fed it?"" The industrial sector of Bangladesh is responsible for 35 percent of the GDP and the employment of 20 million people. The driving forces of export include textiles, pharmaceuticals, and leather, while ceramics, construction, and retail are driving domestic demand. But our environmental metrics are telling a different, grim story: Dhaka ranked among the top 20 cities with the worst air quality, with an AQI score in the moderate to unhealthy range. Around 50 percent of the water of the Buriganga is biologically dead due to pollution. In our ceramic industry, the average Bangladeshi plant still depends significantly on virgin raw materials along with fossil fuel-based kilns, while global brands from Italy are switching to circular and hybrid energy systems. No singular person can take the blame for this; rather, the whole industry is responsible in this regard. But we can't be blind builders anymore! Many industrialists hold this thought firmly in their minds: ""Let's cross the break-even point and get rich, then we will go green,"" but this is a hazardous illusion. The threat of climate change is real, and it is ticking right on our necks. The way the temperature is rising, by 2050, it can slash Bangladesh's GDP by 6.8 percent annually. Soil erosion, water scarcity, and extreme weather will eventually hinder supply chains, increase costs, and create imbalances in the market. So, sustainability is no longer idealism; rather, it is survival economics. The industrial era that strengthened us will not sustain us. Those who extract value without depleting resources, rebuild things without ruining them, and create employment without emitting destruction are the visionaries—the future belongs to them only. Let's not wait for international clients, sanctions, or any climate disaster to wake us up from this illusion. The signs are already very loud and clear: By 2030, leading global fashion brands have demanded net-zero emissions from their supply chain partners. Exporters with higher carbon footprints will be penalized under the EU Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM). Traditional plants are being replaced by green financing; those who will not comply or are not ESG-aligned will not sustain. Factories using solar or waste-heat recovery systems are experiencing 20–30 percent lower operational costs (BERC). According to a published paper by Nielsen, 73 percent of global consumers now demand eco-conscious brands or products. So, ask yourself this question first: Would your factory survive if it had to substantiate its environmental integrity tomorrow? Because while purchasing a T-shirt, an American customer prioritizes the type of water that dyed it, the energy that stitched it, and the process through which it was transported to her home—not the country or place where it was produced. A ceramic buyer from Dubai is no longer looking for just regular tiles; rather, he prefers tiles made with recycled materials, crafted by people with dignity, and produced by a company that cares about more than profit. An investor is not eyeing revenue alone. He looks at a company's resiliency, which comes from sustainability—not just scalability. It's high time every industry implemented some basic tasks like: Redefine Waste as Wealth Start by considering every single ""waste"" stream as a future product line—be it fabric scraps, glass cullet, ceramic dust, steel slag, or heat byproduct. Measure Before You Market Energy audits, ESG scores, water impact reports—set them as your new KPIs. Start using numbers instead of buzzwords. Design for a World That Cares Products should serve their functions and feel ethical, polished, and tell a responsible story. Train Minds, Not Just Hands The next industrial revolution is going to be cognitive. Your employees, engineers, and sales force must all become ambassadors of sustainability. This is not about compliance; rather, it is a vision. Because predictions say the next decade will reward those who see beyond profits. So the choice is yours: Laggards: Stranded assets, regulatory penalties, and consumer backlash. Pioneers: Dominate markets, attract investment, and secure a legacy. I envision that by 2040, Bangladesh will: Reward industrialists not just for competitive prices, but for planet-positive practices. Through green corridors, clean environments, and thriving communities, turn industrial townships into livable ecosystems. Use renewable energy and circular materials to convert factories into zero-waste campuses. Have every single CEO fluent in carbon accounting—just like they are in revenue reports. Some may think I'm fantasizing, but this is already a reality in parts of Europe and East Asia. We don't need to imitate them. Instead, we need to catch up—and lead. In the next 10 years, Bangladesh is on its journey to transform into a middle-income country with over 50 percent urban population, a manufacturing-first economy, and rising global scrutiny. Now the question we need to ask ourselves is whether we prefer to reach there as heroes of green growth—or as villains of climate failure. We are no longer in the era of reckless expansion. We are in the era of conscious creation. Instead of becoming an industrial empire that collapses under its own weight, let us aim to become a role model for the future—where industry builds dreams, not disasters. Bangladesh has experience building miracles before. Now it's time to build meaning. Let's build dreams—but not by breaking our beloved planet. সেনাসদর আরও জানিয়েছে, জাতীয় নিরাপত্তা বিঘ্নিত হয়, সেনাবাহিনী এমন কোনো বিষয়ে সম্পৃক্ত হবে

"The proposed Telecommunication Network & Licensing Regime Reform Policy 2025 marks a welcome shift toward a more streamlined, modern telecom ecosystem in Bangladesh. It includes several forward-thinking provisions but also contains critical ambiguities that must be resolved for the policy to drive sustainable, inclusive sectoral growth. A standout progressive clause is Section 7.2.7, which permits access network service providers (ANSPs) to share both active and passive infrastructure. This is a sensible, cost-efficient move: network sharing reduces redundant capital expenditure and eases pressure on foreign reserves by limiting repeat infrastructure imports and real estate usage. In a resource-constrained economy with growing urban density, such efficiencies are not just desirable—they are essential. Fewer roadworks and construction projects will also reduce public disruption, enhancing urban livability. Section 7.2.9 takes a step in the right direction by aiming to prevent vertical integration abuses. However, it fails to explicitly prohibit cross-shareholding across telecom value chain layers. Without such provisions, dominant players can exploit loopholes and entrench their market power. In this context, clarity isn't optional—it's crucial. Conversely, Section 7.4.6 is commendably clear, barring cellular mobile service providers (CMSPs) from holding fixed telecom service provider (FTSP) licences—a firm stance against horizontal integration. Still, the language could be refined: if CMSPs are to be barred from offering any overlapping services with FTSPs, that must be spelled out to prevent ambiguity. Section 7.5 also needs clarification. It's unclear whether FTSPs may obtain fixed satellite service (FSS) licences. The criteria for these licenses must be clearly defined, including whether local distributors require a separate licence or only need to register with the regulator. Similarly, Section 7.3.2 vaguely defines cellular mobile standards. References to ITU benchmarks like IMT-2020 (5G) must be made explicit. Given the complexity of ITU standards, investors deserve precise guidance on applicability and compliance. The draft also lacks a coherent stance on foreign direct investment (FDI). While majority foreign ownership may be allowed for some licence categories, like national infrastructure connectivity service providers (NICSPs), it remains silent on foreign ownership thresholds (whether majority means some local ownership is required) for them or for ANSPs, while capping it at 49 percent for international connectivity service providers (ICSPs). This inconsistency undermines investor confidence. If the goal, per Section 2.5, is to foster local entrepreneurship, ownership rules should either be applied consistently or justified individually. For instance, full foreign ownership might be warranted for capital-intensive and state-of-the-art technologies like FSS ventures, while majority local ownership could be mandated for district-level FTSPs to promote homegrown entrepreneurs and enable tech transfer through equity partnerships. The CMSP licence class poses a strategic dilemma. While openness to foreign investment is vital, overreliance on foreign capital risks excluding domestic players from a sector of national significance. Grameenphone showcases a successful model of blended ownership. Policymakers must now decide whether to preserve this balance, allow further foreign dominance, or ideally, evolve toward inclusive economic participation. Another critical issue lies in how non-geostationary satellite operators (NGSOs) are handled—currently grouped under FTSPs. This is conceptually flawed. NGSO services like Starlink use entirely different access technologies and should be regulated under a distinct ANSP licence class. This category needs tailored provisions for retail, billing, compliance, and consumer protection. Importantly, when primary subscribers redistribute connectivity, KYC compliance must be mandatory, ensuring regulatory parity with other ANSPs. A recent comment by the special assistant to the chief adviser at MoPTICT, suggesting customers may need a no objection certificate (NOC) for FSS connectivity, raises further concerns. Does this imply BTRC approval will be needed for all new connections, or will FSS providers face a different process? The draft NGSO guidelines offer no clarity. Finally, Section 7.6 introduces flexibility for telecom-enabled services but undermines it with a vague ""enlistment"" requirement. Regulatory adaptability is essential for innovation—but vagueness is not. Enlistment should either be mandatory or explicitly optional. Leaving it undefined invites bureaucratic discretion and potential misuse. A more pragmatic approach would be to let licensed ANSPs assume regulatory responsibility for the services they enable, sparing individual providers from unnecessary red tape. This would foster innovation while allowing the regulator to focus on service quality and consumer protection. In conclusion, the draft telecom licensing policy is a welcome move toward modernisation. But to be truly transformative, it needs sharper articulation in key areas: FDI policy, licensing structure, service classification, and ownership rules. As we overhaul a decades-old system—potentially for the next 10 to 20 years—our policy must be not just forward-looking, but coherent, inclusive, and transparent, designed to attract investment while empowering local innovation. সেনাসদর আরও জানিয়েছে, জাতীয় নিরাপত্তা বিঘ্নিত হয়, সেনাবাহিনী এমন কোনো বিষয়ে সম্পৃক্ত হবে

"Petrobangla has issued a clarification in response to what it described as ""misleading and confusing"" statements made by representatives of various associations regarding gas supply to industrial establishments. The state-run oil, gas, and mineral corporation issued the statement a day after textile and garment industry owners claimed that many mills are on the verge of shutting down, as they are unable to operate even at minimum capacity due to an acute gas crisis. Today, Petrobangla said the actual gas supply data contradict the claims circulated in the media. Between January and April this year, the average daily gas supply to the industrial sector stood at 997 million cubic feet (mmcfd), up 21 percent from 823 mmcfd in the same period of 2024, it said. In April alone, supply reached 1,088 mmcfd, a rise of around 50 percent year-on-year, the statement added. To meet the growing industrial demand, Petrobangla has arranged the import of six additional liquefied natural gas (LNG) cargoes this year, it said. The import cost of LNG is about Tk 65 per cubic metre, while industrial users pay Tk 30 and captive power producers Tk 31.50 per cubic metre. The government is subsidising Tk 35 per cubic metre of gas supplied under the current pricing structure. Citing additional LNG imports and adjustments in sector-wise distribution, Petrobangla said it plans to supply an extra 150 mmcfd from Wednesday. ""The government is actively working to ensure adequate gas supply to industries and has taken timely measures to that end. We hope this clarification will dispel any misunderstandings surrounding the issue,"" the statement said. সেনাসদর আরও জানিয়েছে, জাতীয় নিরাপত্তা বিঘ্নিত হয়, সেনাবাহিনী এমন কোনো বিষয়ে সম্পৃক্ত হবে না।",2025-05-26T09:32:30Z,petrobanglahasissuedaclarificationinresponsetowhatitdescribedasmisleadingandconfusingstatementsmadebyrepresentativesofvariousassociationsregardinggassupplytoindustrialestablishmentsthestaterunoilgasandmineralcorporationissuedthestatementadayaftertextileandgarmentindustryownersclaimedthatmanymillsareonthevergeofshuttingdownastheyareunabletooperateevenatminimumcapacityduetoanacutegascrisistodaypetrobanglasaidtheactualgassupplydatacontradicttheclaimscirculatedinthemediabetweenjanuaryandaprilthisyeartheaveragedailygassupplytotheindustrialsectorstoodatmillioncubicfeetmmcfduppercentfrommmcfdinthesameperiodofitsaidinaprilalonesupplyreachedmmcfdariseofaroundpercentyearonyearthestatementaddedtomeetthegrowingindustrialdemandpetrobanglahasarrangedtheimportofsixadditionalliquefiednaturalgaslngcargoesthisyearitsaidtheimportcostoflngisabouttkpercubicmetrewhileindustrialuserspaytkandcaptivepowerproducerstkpercubicmetrethegovernmentissubsidisingtkpercubicmetreofgassuppliedunderthecurrentpricingstructurecitingadditionallngimportsandadjustmentsinsectorwisedistributionpetrobanglasaiditplanstosupplyanextrammcfdfromwednesdaythegovernmentisactivelyworkingtoensureadequategassupplytoindustriesandhastakentimelymeasurestothatendwehopethisclarificationwilldispelanymisunderstandingssurroundingtheissuethecastatementcasaideabeaeaaeabeeabeaaeabeaeabeaeaceabeeaaeabfeafeaeabeaeaceabeeaaeaeafeaaeabfeabeabeeaaaeaaealaughingeaaeabeeaaceabfeaealaughingeaaeabfeaaeabeafeabeaeaaeabeeaaceabeeabeabfeaaeaeafeaaeeaaeaeabeaaeabeaaceabfeabeafeaeabeaaeealaughingeaaaeaeaealaughingeaaeabeaaceaeaaeabeeaa
"On this day, May 26, two decades ago, a teenage Mushfiqur Rahim took his first steps into the world of international cricket: a journey that would go on to redefine resilience, longevity and dedication in Bangladesh cricket. It was 2005 when an 18-year-old Mushfiqur, a surprise inclusion in Bangladesh's squad for their maiden tour of England, debuted at the iconic Lord's Cricket Ground.  That day, he became the youngest cricketer to play a Test at the Home of Cricket. Today, as he completes 20 years in international cricket, the memory remains etched in his heart--a sentiment he shared through a nostalgic Facebook post with a heartfelt message and a collage of his career: ""Alhamdulillah 20 years of international cricket."" In March this year, the veteran wicketkeeper-batter bid farewell to ODIs, having already stepped away from T20Is in 2022.  With only Test cricket left in his repertoire, Mushfiqur now stands just four matches away from becoming the first Bangladeshi to play 100 Tests: a milestone that could etch his name even deeper into national cricketing folklore. However, the road ahead is not without its challenges. His recent dip in form--managing only 44 runs in two home Tests against Zimbabwe-- has raised questions. But if there's one thing Mushfiqur has always proven, it's his ability to bounce back. Tests: 96 matches, 6055 runs, highest score 219*, average 37.37
 ODIs: 274 matches, 7795 runs, highest score 144, average 36.42 T20Is: 102 matches, 1500 runs, highest score 72*, average 19.48

"New Real Madrid coach Xabi Alonso said Monday he has the energy and excitement to deliver success worthy of the Spanish giants as he was presented as Carlo Ancelotti's replacement. Alonso will lead the team at the Club World Cup this summer and has signed a three-year deal until June 2028, after Ancelotti departed to take charge of the Brazil national team. Madrid failed to win a major trophy this season, losing their La Liga crown to rivals Barcelona, who also beat them in the Copa del Rey and Spanish Super Cup finals. Real were dealt a heavy Champions League quarter-final defeat by Arsenal as their European trophy defence also fell short. ""We have fantastic players, we have a team that has a lot of potential, (capable of) a very good present and a very good future,"" Alonso said at Real Madrid's training ground. ""That gives me a lot of reason to come here with a lot of energy and a lot of hope that I can get the best out of all the players and build a great team... ""(I have) the conviction that we can achieve big things, worthy of Real Madrid, worthy of all these European Cups, of all these accomplishments made over so many years."" Alonso, a technically gifted central midfielder in his playing days, made 236 Madrid appearances between 2009-2014, winning six trophies including the Champions League in his final season at the club. That was Madrid's 10th European Cup - La Decima - and they have gone on to win five more in the past decade for a record 15 Champions League triumphs. The 43-year-old coach led Bayer Leverkusen to a superb unbeaten Bundesliga and German Cup double in the 2023-24 campaign, making him a target for Europe's top clubs. Alonso, who was coached by Ancelotti, Pep Guardiola and Jose Mourinho among other managerial greats, said it was a ""special day"". ""It's a day I will have marked in my calendar for life,"" continued Alonso. ""I have been away from here for a few years, but I think the link with Madrid and the fans has never ended, it's always been there. ""And today, when I walked into Valdebebas (the club's training ground) an hour and a half ago, it was reborn... I have the feeling that it's the start of an era, as the president said."" - 'One of our own' - Madrid chief Florentino Perez gave an introductory speech welcoming Alonso back to the Spanish capital. ""This is a very special day for those who love Real Madrid, it will be the start of a new era filled with excitement and intense emotions,"" said Madrid president Perez. ""A coach arrives who is one of the best in the world, and who knows what this badge and this shirt means... ""Today we welcome one of our own -- Xabi Alonso. Welcome back to your home, Real Madrid."" Former Liverpool and Bayern Munich midfielder Alonso also won the 2010 World Cup and two European Championships with Spain before starting his coaching career. Real Madrid's Club World Cup campaign starts against Saudi Arabian side Al-Hilal in Miami on June 18, which will be the first look at Alonso's project. সেনাসদর আরও জানিয়েছে, জাতীয় নিরাপত্তা বিঘ্নিত হয়, সেনাবাহিনী এমন কোনো বিষয়ে সম্পৃক্ত হবে না।",2025-05-26T11:55:36Z,newrealmadridcoachxabialonsosaidmondayhehastheenergyandexcitementtodeliversuccessworthyofthespanishgiantsashewaspresentedascarloancelottiisreplacementalonsowillleadtheteamattheclubworldcupthissummerandhassignedathreeyeardealuntiljuneafterancelottidepartedtotakechargeofthebrazilnationalteammadridfailedtowinamajortrophythisseasonlosingtheirlaligacrowntorivalsbarcelonawhoalsobeattheminthecopadelreyandspanishsupercupfinalsrealweredealtaheavychampionsleaguequarterfinaldefeatbyarsenalastheireuropeantrophydefencealsofellshortwehavefantasticplayerswehaveateamthathasalotofpotentialcapableofaverygoodpresentandaverygoodfuturealonsosaidatrealmadridistraininggroundthatgivesmealotofreasontocomeherewithalotofenergyandalotofhopethaticangetthebestoutofalltheplayersandbuildagreatteamihavetheconvictionthatwecanachievebigthingsworthyofrealmadridworthyofalltheseeuropeancupsofalltheseaccomplishmentsmadeoversomanyyearsalonsoatechnicallygiftedcentralmidfielderinhisplayingdaysmademadridappearancesbetweenwinningsixtrophiesincludingthechampionsleagueinhisfinalseasonattheclubthatwasmadridistheuropeancupladecimaandtheyhavegoneontowinfivemoreinthepastdecadeforarecordchampionsleaguetriumphstheyearoldcoachledbayerleverkusentoasuperbunbeatenbundesligaandgermancupdoubleinthecampaignmakinghimatargetforeuropeistopclubsalonsowhowascoachedbyancelottipepguardiolaandjosemourinhoamongothermanagerialgreatssaiditwasaspecialdayitisadayiwillhavemarkedinmycalendarforlifecontinuedalonsoihavebeenawayfromhereforafewyearsbutithinkthelinkwithmadridandthefanshasneverendeditisalwaysbeenthereandtodaywheniwalkedintovaldebebastheclubistraininggroundanhourandahalfagoitwasrebornihavethefeelingthatitisthestartofaneraasthepresidentsaidoneofourownmadridchiefflorentinoperezgaveanintroductoryspeechwelcomingalonsobacktothespanishcapitalthisisaveryspecialdayforthosewholoverealmadriditwillbethestartofanewerafilledwithexcitementandintenseemotionssaidmadridpresidentperezacoacharriveswhoisoneofthebestintheworldandwhoknowswhatthisbadgeandthisshirtmeanstodaywewelcomeoneofourownxabialonsowelcomebacktoyourhomerealmadridformerliverpoolandbayernmunichmidfielderalonsoalsowontheworldcupandtwoeuropeanchampionshipswithspainbeforestartinghiscoachingcareerrealmadridisclubworldcupcampaignstartsagainstsaudiarabiansidealhilalinmiamionjunewhichwillbethefirstlookatalonsoisprojecteabeaeaaeabeeabeaaeabeaeabeaeaceabeeaaeabfeafeaeabeaeaceabeeaaeaeafeaaeabfeabeabeeaaaeaaealaughingeaaeabeeaaceabfeaealaughingeaaeabfeaaeabeafeabeaeaaeabeeaaceabeeabeabfeaaeaeafeaaeeaaeaeabeaaeabeaaceabfeabeafeaeabeaaeealaughingeaaaeaeaealaughingeaaeabeaaceaeaaeabeeaa
"Argentina's Mac Allister brothers Alexis and Kevin pulled off an unusual family feat on Sunday by lifting championship trophies on the same afternoon in different countries, though neither of them took part in their teams' final game of the season. Alexis got his hands on the Premier League trophy at Anfield after Liverpool secured the title last month, while his older brother Kevin endured a nervy afternoon in Belgium as his club Union Saint-Gilloise ended a 90-year wait for the championship. While Kevin was suspended for their last fixture of the season at home to Gent, where a 3-1 win was enough to see them win a first title since 1935, Alexis sat out Liverpool's final match at home to Crystal Palace to avoid injury. ""I think he played throughout the last part of the season with the Argentinian mentality he has,"" Liverpool manager Arne Slot said. ""Never gives up, no matter what he feels, but it is not smart to play a player that has, not a big injury but something to take a risk with."" The 26-year-old midfielder, who was in the Argentina side that won the World Cup in Qatar, moved to Liverpool from Brighton & Hove Albion two seasons ago and started 30 games in their title-winning campaign. Kevin, a year older, plays further back but exhibits the same resilient characteristics as his brother. Het Nieuwsblad described the defender on Monday as ""a soldier who never gives up"". ""He played in recent weeks with a mask, a bandaged shoulder, and a taped knee, but refused to give up due to injury."" Kevin said it had been tough not to be on the field helping his teammates. ""It was difficult to watch the game from the sidelines. I was calm, even though the first half wasn't our best,"" he told reporters. ""I always try to keep the group calm. Sometimes emotions get too high and that's not good. I'm glad we stayed calm and finished it off."" A third brother, 29-year-old Francis, currently plays in Argentina's top flight with Insituto. All three brothers started at Argentinos Juniors, appearing together for the first time in 2017. Their father Carlos won three caps for Argentina and played at Boca Juniors, where he won a league championship in 1992. সেনাসদর আরও জানিয়েছে, জাতীয় নিরাপত্তা বিঘ্নিত হয়, সেনাবাহিনী এমন কোনো বিষয়ে সম্পৃক্ত হবে না।",2025-05-26T08:33:41Z,argentinaismacallisterbrothersalexisandkevinpulledoffanunusualfamilyfeatonsundaybyliftingchampionshiptrophiesonthesameafternoonindifferentcountriesthoughneitherofthemtookpartintheirteamsfinalgameoftheseasonalexisgothishandsonthepremierleaguetrophyatanfieldafterliverpoolsecuredthetitlelastmonthwhilehisolderbrotherkevinenduredanervyafternooninbelgiumashisclubunionsaintgilloiseendedayearwaitforthechampionshipwhilekevinwassuspendedfortheirlastfixtureoftheseasonathometogentwhereawinwasenoughtoseethemwinafirsttitlesincealexissatoutliverpoolisfinalmatchathometocrystalpalacetoavoidinjuryithinkheplayedthroughoutthelastpartoftheseasonwiththeargentinianmentalityhehasliverpoolmanagerarneslotsaidnevergivesupnomatterwhathefeelsbutitisnotsmarttoplayaplayerthathasnotabiginjurybutsomethingtotakeariskwiththeyearoldmidfielderwhowasintheargentinasidethatwontheworldcupinqatarmovedtoliverpoolfrombrightonhovealbiontwoseasonsagoandstartedgamesintheirtitlewinningcampaignkevinayearolderplaysfurtherbackbutexhibitsthesameresilientcharacteristicsashisbrotherhetnieuwsbladdescribedthedefenderonmondayasasoldierwhonevergivesupheplayedinrecentweekswithamaskabandagedshoulderandatapedkneebutrefusedtogiveupduetoinjurykevinsaidithadbeentoughnottobeonthefieldhelpinghisteammatesitwasdifficulttowatchthegamefromthesidelinesiwascalmeventhoughthefirsthalfwasnotourbesthetoldreportersialwaystrytokeepthegroupcalmsometimesemotionsgettoohighandthatisnotgoodiamgladwestayedcalmandfinisheditoffathirdbrotheryearoldfranciscurrentlyplaysinargentinaistopflightwithinsitutoallthreebrothersstartedatargentinosjuniorsappearingtogetherforthefirsttimeintheirfathercarloswonthreecapsforargentinaandplayedatbocajuniorswherehewonaleaguechampionshipineabeaeaaeabeeabeaaeabeaeabeaeaceabeeaaeabfeafeaeabeaeaceabeeaaeaeafeaaeabfeabeabeeaaaeaaealaughingeaaeabeeaaceabfeaealaughingeaaeabfeaaeabeafeabeaeaaeabeeaaceabeeabeabfeaaeaeafeaaeeaaeaeabeaaeabeaaceabfeabeafeaeabeaaeealaughingeaaaeaeaealaughingeaaeabeaaceaeaaeabeeaa
"South Korea hope Son Heung-min's European success can rub off on the national side when the skipper leads them into crucial World Cup qualifiers next week. Fresh from lifting the Europa League trophy with Tottenham Hotspur, Son will captain a South Korea squad named Monday who need just a draw against Iraq in Basra on June 5 to reach the World Cup. Failing that, the Koreans will have another chance to clinch a spot in next year's showpiece in the USA, Canada and Mexico against Kuwait in Seoul five days later. South Korea coach Hong Myung-bo said he hoped to squeeze even more out of his captain before the end of the season after Son won his first major trophy after 10 years at Tottenham. ""He has always done so well for himself individually, and for him to be captain of the team that won such a big title is something we should be proud of,"" Hong said of Tottenham's 1-0 win over Manchester United in the Europa League final in Bilbao last week. ""After a long season there is no reward quite like lifting a trophy at the end. ""Hopefully his victory will have some positive impact on the national team."" Bayern Munich defender Kim Min-jae was left out of the squad because of injury. South Korea top Asian qualifying Group B on 16 points with two rounds of matches to be played. Jordan are second on 13, Iraq third on 12 and Oman fourth on 10. The top two teams qualify for the World Cup, with the next two progressing into a further round of qualifying. সেনাসদর আরও জানিয়েছে, জাতীয় নিরাপত্তা বিঘ্নিত হয়, সেনাবাহিনী এমন কোনো বিষয়ে সম্পৃক্ত হবে না।",2025-05-26T06:53:24Z,southkoreahopesonheungminiseuropeansuccesscanruboffonthenationalsidewhentheskipperleadsthemintocrucialworldcupqualifiersnextweekfreshfromliftingtheeuropaleaguetrophywithtottenhamhotspursonwillcaptainasouthkoreasquadnamedmondaywhoneedjustadrawagainstiraqinbasraonjunetoreachtheworldcupfailingthatthekoreanswillhaveanotherchancetoclinchaspotinnextyearisshowpieceintheusacanadaandmexicoagainstkuwaitinseoulfivedayslatersouthkoreacoachhongmyungbosaidhehopedtosqueezeevenmoreoutofhiscaptainbeforetheendoftheseasonaftersonwonhisfirstmajortrophyafteryearsattottenhamhehasalwaysdonesowellforhimselfindividuallyandforhimtobecaptainoftheteamthatwonsuchabigtitleissomethingweshouldbeproudofhongsaidoftottenhamiswinovermanchesterunitedintheeuropaleaguefinalinbilbaolastweekafteralongseasonthereisnorewardquitelikeliftingatrophyattheendhopefullyhisvictorywillhavesomepositiveimpactonthenationalteambayernmunichdefenderkimminjaewasleftoutofthesquadbecauseofinjurysouthkoreatopasianqualifyinggroupbonpointswithtworoundsofmatchestobeplayedjordanaresecondoniraqthirdonandomanfourthonthetoptwoteamsqualifyfortheworldcupwiththenexttwoprogressingintoafurtherroundofqualifyingeabeaeaaeabeeabeaaeabeaeabeaeaceabeeaaeabfeafeaeabeaeaceabeeaaeaeafeaaeabfeabeabeeaaaeaaealaughingeaaeabeeaaceabfeaealaughingeaaeabfeaaeabeafeabeaeaaeabeeaaceabeeabeabfeaaeaeafeaaeeaaeaeabeaaeabeaaceabfeabeafeaeabeaaeealaughingeaaaeaeaealaughingeaaeabeaaceaeaaeabeeaa
"Bangladesh Women's football team have left Dhaka for Amman, Jordan today for two friendlies against hosts Jordan and Indonesia ahead of their Women's Asian Cup Qualifiers, scheduled next month. ""The Bangladesh National Women's Football Team is en route to Amman, Jordan, to participate in two international FIFA friendly matches during the official FIFA Women's International Match Window,"" BFF said in a press release. The 30-member Bangladesh contingent, with 23 booters and seven coaching staff, departed in the morning. They will transit in Manama, Bahrain and are scheduled to land in Amman today. The women's team will face Jordan on May 31 and Indonesia in June as part of the series. The BFF announced a 23-member squad for the friendly matches yesterday. Nine booters who had protested for the removal of head coach Peter Butler in February were called up while five SAFF Championship winners including Sabina Khatun, who led the protests against Butler, was left out. Soon after the friendlies in Jordan, Bangladesh will compete in the Asian Cup Qualifiers. Bangladesh have been slotted in Group C and will face Myanmar, Bahrain and Turkmenistan in the qualifiers, which will run from June 23 to July 5. সেনাসদর আরও জানিয়েছে, জাতীয় নিরাপত্তা বিঘ্নিত হয়, সেনাবাহিনী এমন কোনো বিষয়ে সম্পৃক্ত হবে না।",2025-05-26T06:08:14Z,bangladeshwomenisfootballteamhaveleftdhakaforammanjordantodayfortwofriendliesagainsthostsjordanandindonesiaaheadoftheirwomenisasiancupqualifiersschedulednextmonththebangladeshnationalwomenisfootballteamisenroutetoammanjordantoparticipateintwointernationalfifafriendlymatchesduringtheofficialfifawomenisinternationalmatchwindowbffsaidinapressreleasethememberbangladeshcontingentwithbootersandsevencoachingstaffdepartedinthemorningtheywilltransitinmanamabahrainandarescheduledtolandinammantodaythewomenisteamwillfacejordanonmayandindonesiainjuneaspartoftheseriesthebffannouncedamembersquadforthefriendlymatchesyesterdayninebooterswhohadprotestedfortheremovalofheadcoachpeterbutlerinfebruarywerecalledupwhilefivesaffchampionshipwinnersincludingsabinakhatunwholedtheprotestsagainstbutlerwasleftoutsoonafterthefriendliesinjordanbangladeshwillcompeteintheasiancupqualifiersbangladeshhavebeenslottedingroupcandwillfacemyanmarbahrainandturkmenistaninthequalifierswhichwillrunfromjunetojulyeabeaeaaeabeeabeaaeabeaeabeaeaceabeeaaeabfeafeaeabeaeaceabeeaaeaeafeaaeabfeabeabeeaaaeaaealaughingeaaeabeeaaceabfeaealaughingeaaeabfeaaeabeafeabeaeaaeabeeaaceabeeabeabfeaaeaeafeaaeeaaeaeabeaaeabeaaceabfeabeafeaeabeaaeealaughingeaaaeaeaealaughingeaaeabeaaceaeaaeabeeaa
"Rafael Nadal said on Sunday he ""doesn't miss tennis much"" after retiring from the sport last year as a 22-time Grand Slam champion. Roland Garros held an emotional tribute to the 14-time French Open winner's career on the opening day of the tournament, six months after Nadal played his final match. ""I don't miss tennis much, because I feel that I gave it all that I had,"" Nadal told reporters. ""I arrived today with the peace that I can't be on court. My body don't allow me to be on court. So that's all. I am in peace. ""I did all that I could to have the best career possible, and now I am enjoying this new phase of my life, that I am sure is going to be less exciting than the tennis career, because the adrenaline that sports gives to you, I think it's impossible to find in other things in life. ""But that doesn't mean I'm gonna be less happy."" The 38-year-old said he has not played at all since ending his illustrious career last November, instead focusing on his tennis academy, charitable foundation and business interests. ""I didn't touch a racquet yet after my retirement. So it's (six) months without being on a tennis court,"" he added. ""But I will. I will be back at some point, because at some point I will prepare myself to play an exhibition or something like this."" Nadal said he even briefly lost his famous competitive edge after retiring, including on the golf course. ""I don't know why. But I was playing golf or anything else, and I didn't care if I lose, if I win, if I play well, if I play bad. It was a strange feeling for me, and not funny. ""I didn't like to experience that, being honest, because I understand the sport in another way. But that's past. I am competitive again.""

"Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan is renowned for building the Taj Mahal, but few know that he also spent a week in Dhaka -- long before he ascended the throne. At the time, Shah Jahan was still a prince -- called Prince Khurram -- embroiled in a power struggle with his father, Emperor Jahangir. The emperor's influential wife, Empress Nur Jahan, had begun to dominate the court and feared losing power if Shah Jahan became emperor. In April 1622, she married her daughter Ladli Begum to Jahangir's youngest son, Shahriyar, hoping to rule through him. To sideline Shah Jahan, she convinced Jahangir to send him to Kandahar to confront Persian forces led by Shah Abbas. But the prince saw through this plan and refused to go -- effectively rebelling. He gathered forces in the Deccan, but after suffering defeat, he fled eastward toward Bengal, which, with its riverine geography, offered a natural stronghold for rebels. In mid-November 1623, he and his small army crossed into Orissa. The Mughal court in Delhi immediately alerted Ibrahim Khan, the Subahdar (Governor) of Bengal, stationed in Dhaka. He was advised to monitor Orissa's Subahdar, Ahmad Beg Khan. But Ahmad Beg did nothing when Shah Jahan entered Orissa. Soon after, the prince moved to Burdwan, captured the fort there, and sent shockwaves through Mughal administration. Ibrahim Khan acted swiftly. He secured key outposts in Jessore, Tripura, Bhola, Sylhet, Fuldubi, and Cachar. His personal aide Idris was entrusted with the safety of the Dhaka harem, backed by 500 cavalry and 1000 gunners. Realising the prince might march on Dhaka, Ibrahim Khan advanced to Akbarnagar (Rajmahal) to intercept him before he could reach the capital -- a standard medieval military tactic. At the start of 1624, Shah Jahan tried diplomacy and invited Ibrahim Khan to switch allegiance. But the Subahdar, loyal to Emperor Jahangir, refused. A major battle became inevitable. Unfortunately, Ibrahim Khan had deployed his experienced troops elsewhere and led the fight with inexperienced forces. He was killed in the battle — struck down by an Afghan soldier unaware of his identity. Shah Jahan's forces triumphed. Out of respect for the fallen Subahdar's abilities, the prince ensured Ibrahim Khan's head was not displayed publicly and allowed it to be buried with his body beside his son's grave. With victory secured, Shah Jahan rewarded his loyal commanders. Darab Khan, who had aided in the battle of Rajmahal, was appointed in charge of Dhaka with increased military strength. Shah Jahan began his journey to Dhaka, entrusting the Rajmahal palace to Raja Bhim. After visiting the shrine of Sheikh Nur Qutub Alam in Pandua and setting camp at Ghoraghat, he dispatched Khwaja Idrak ahead to calm any unrest in the capital. Six days after leaving Rajmahal, he camped in Shahjadpur, and arrived in Dhaka three days later, in May 1624. Khwaja Idrak's efforts paid off -- there was no resistance. Ibrahim Khan's widow, preparing to flee with her possessions to Patna, was stopped by Shah Jahan's advance forces. Understanding the situation, local officials and Mughal officers came out in ranks to welcome the prince. Even the late Subahdar's widow greeted him respectfully. Shah Jahan took residence in the Dhaka Fort -- the site we commonly refer to as Dhaka Central Jail. As Bengal's de facto ruler, he restored law and order in various regions, including Cooch Behar and Kamrup. But his primary goal was fundraising for his campaign to seize the throne in Delhi. Ibrahim Khan's nephew, Ahmad Beg, had already handed over property worth Tk 45 lakh and 500 elephants. By confiscating the late Subahdar's wealth, Shah Jahan acquired valuable goods, including silk, musabbar, weapons, and an additional Tk 40 lakh. After a week in Dhaka, Shah Jahan left the city -- sending his commanders over land and himself departing by river. সেনাসদর আরও জানিয়েছে, জাতীয় নিরাপত্তা বিঘ্নিত হয়, সেনাবাহিনী এমন কোনো বিষয়ে সম্পৃক্ত হবে না।",2025-05-25T18:43:35Z,mughalemperorshahjahanisrenownedforbuildingthetajmahalbutfewknowthathealsospentaweekindhakalongbeforeheascendedthethroneatthetimeshahjahanwasstillaprincecalledprincekhurramembroiledinapowerstrugglewithhisfatheremperorjahangirtheemperorisinfluentialwifeempressnurjahanhadbeguntodominatethecourtandfearedlosingpowerifshahjahanbecameemperorinaprilshemarriedherdaughterladlibegumtojahangirisyoungestsonshahriyarhopingtorulethroughhimtosidelineshahjahansheconvincedjahangirtosendhimtokandahartoconfrontpersianforcesledbyshahabbasbuttheprincesawthroughthisplanandrefusedtogoeffectivelyrebellinghegatheredforcesinthedeccanbutaftersufferingdefeathefledeastwardtowardbengalwhichwithitsriverinegeographyofferedanaturalstrongholdforrebelsinmidnovemberheandhissmallarmycrossedintoorissathemughalcourtindelhiimmediatelyalertedibrahimkhanthesubahdargovernorofbengalstationedindhakahewasadvisedtomonitororissaissubahdarahmadbegkhanbutahmadbegdidnothingwhenshahjahanenteredorissasoonaftertheprincemovedtoburdwancapturedthefortthereandsentshockwavesthroughmughaladministrationibrahimkhanactedswiftlyhesecuredkeyoutpostsinjessoretripurabholasylhetfuldubiandcacharhispersonalaideidriswasentrustedwiththesafetyofthedhakaharembackedbycavalryandgunnersrealisingtheprincemightmarchondhakaibrahimkhanadvancedtoakbarnagarrajmahaltointercepthimbeforehecouldreachthecapitalastandardmedievalmilitarytacticatthestartofshahjahantrieddiplomacyandinvitedibrahimkhantoswitchallegiancebutthesubahdarloyaltoemperorjahangirrefusedamajorbattlebecameinevitableunfortunatelyibrahimkhanhaddeployedhisetonguestickingouteriencedtroopselsewhereandledthefightwithinetonguestickingouteriencedforceshewaskilledinthebattleestruckdownbyanafghansoldierunawareofhisidentityshahjahanisforcestriumphedoutofrespectforthefallensubahdarisabilitiestheprinceensuredibrahimkhanisheadwasnotdisplayedpubliclyandallowedittobeburiedwithhisbodybesidehissonisgravewithvictorysecuredshahjahanrewardedhisloyalcommandersdarabkhanwhohadaidedinthebattleofrajmahalwasappointedinchargeofdhakawithincreasedmilitarystrengthshahjahanbeganhisjourneytodhakaentrustingtherajmahalpalacetorajabhimaftervisitingtheshrineofsheikhnurqutubalaminpanduaandsettingcampatghoraghathedispatchedkhwajaidrakaheadtocalmanyunrestinthecapitalsixdaysafterleavingrajmahalhecampedinshahjadpurandarrivedindhakathreedayslaterinmaykhwajaidrakiseffortspaidofftherewasnoresistanceibrahimkhaniswidowpreparingtofleewithherpossessionstopatnawasstoppedbyshahjahanisadvanceforcesunderstandingthesituationlocalofficialsandmughalofficerscameoutinrankstowelcometheprinceeventhelatesubahdariswidowgreetedhimrespectfullyshahjahantookresidenceinthedhakafortthesitewecommonlyrefertoasdhakacentraljailasbengalisdefactorulerherestoredlawandorderinvariousregionsincludingcoochbeharandkamrupbuthisprimarygoalwasfundraisingforhiscampaigntoseizethethroneindelhiibrahimkhanisnephewahmadbeghadalreadyhandedoverpropertyworthtklakhandelephantsbyconfiscatingthelatesubahdariswealthshahjahanacquiredvaluablegoodsincludingsilkmusabbarweaponsandanadditionaltklakhafteraweekindhakashahjahanleftthecitysendinghiscommandersoverlandandhimselfdepartingbyrivereabeaeaaeabeeabeaaeabeaeabeaeaceabeeaaeabfeafeaeabeaeaceabeeaaeaeafeaaeabfeabeabeeaaaeaaealaughingeaaeabeeaaceabfeaealaughingeaaeabfeaaeabeafeabeaeaaeabeeaaceabeeabeabfeaaeaeafeaaeeaaeaeabeaaeabeaaceabfeabeafeaeabeaaeealaughingeaaaeaeaealaughingeaaeabeaaceaeaaeabeeaa
"Every locality in this city has stories, and none seem to speak louder than the anecdotes shared by walls! Case in point: Shantinagar! Having lived here for over four decades, I am no stranger to the tales they offer, and curiously, these narratives are ever-changing. As a child, I witnessed the fall of the Ershad regime. Once the dictator was removed from power, the entire neighbourhood came alive with graffiti boldly championing change. The shift in the political landscape was evident simply by looking at the walls. The area's status as an electoral hotspot meant its plastered boundaries remained a vibrant canvas for ""chikamara"" (the term locals used for graffiti) even after the downfall of autocracy. With the advent of technology, these were replaced by posters, sometimes making their point in simple topography and, at times, with grotesque imageries of things done wrong to people with opposing views. [Of course, graffiti came in the limelight once again after the fall of the Hasina-regime. The slogans this time were not just political, but at times, deeply personal, turning every brick into a bulletin board of public dissent.] In my teens, I began to notice things more seriously. One of the more familiar sights back then was the crowd that gathered around walls with daily newspapers glued on the plaster. Here, you did not just read the headlines, you also got unsolicited commentary from the person beside you, and a regular dose of conspiracy theories from ""analysts."" Now in my mid-forties, I spot office-goers dressed in crisp shirts, pressed trousers, and formal shoes, pausing at the same corners jotting down bits of information. Fast forward to the 2020s, the walls has embraced new messages. The newspaper section is gone and at every turn, you will find flyers offering rooms for rent. No surprises there, but there's a catch! The ""to-let"" notices rarely advertise full apartments anymore. Instead, they seek tenants for single rooms or shared mess seats at affordable prices. The ads are simple, no frills; just a brief line and a phone number. Some are ""For men only,"" others ""For females,"" and every now and then, you come across a sign declaring ""Only Family"" with such urgency, it feels like the wall itself is shouting, ""Bachelors not welcome!"" Amidst the sea lie the curious renegade; advertisements for the proverbial ghotok (matchmakers)and their modern-day competition, matrimonial websites. There is also the poster for the Kazi, government endorsed agents who scribes the marital document, the kabin-nama. I shudder at the thought of the ""tantrik-sadhu"" making his appearance, promising cure to marital discord and a lot of earthly problems! Of course, there are also the run-of-the mill advertisements of coaching centres. From offering to preparing students for madrassas and cadet colleges to medical and university admissions, every inch of wall space seems to be taken. Some promise miracle IELTS scores in just three months, results that seem achievable by none but the most proficient in English. Others promise you to teach Korean at Farmgate! And then there are remnants of advertising trends that never caught on. The ""Manobotar Dewal"" initiative, launched during the pandemic, encouraged residents to hang their used clothes on the walls for the less fortunate to take. Now, only the words and hooks remain, reminding us that in a city that has now turned cold, humanity makes a comeback only in times of peril. I have always believed that you can measure the economic condition of a neighbourhood by the stories its walls share. And in Shantinagar, it's clear that the hard realities of life are leaving its mark. After all, it is no longer an affluent part of the city, now mostly called home by the burgeoning middle-class. The modest, time-worn walls call upon the residents of this locality to hear their stories, and while doing so, echo the voices of the very people that they themselves were built to guard. PS: In a way, the walls have now moved online. Facebook groups and messenger threads dedicated to Shantinagar are now ""plastered"" with the same notices, tuition ads, lost-and-found announcements for cats, pest control, and coaching centre promotions! It's as if the walls have taken to the Internet, and still screaming just as loudly. সেনাসদর আরও জানিয়েছে, জাতীয় নিরাপত্তা বিঘ্নিত হয়, সেনাবাহিনী এমন কোনো বিষয়ে সম্পৃক্ত হবে না।",2025-05-23T18:53:07Z,everylocalityinthiscityhasstoriesandnoneseemtospeaklouderthantheanecdotessharedbywallscaseinpointshantinagarhavinglivedhereforoverfourdecadesiamnostrangertothetalestheyofferandcuriouslythesenarrativesareeverchangingasachildiwitnessedthefalloftheershadregimeoncethedictatorwasremovedfrompowertheentireneighbourhoodcamealivewithgraffitiboldlychampioningchangetheshiftinthepoliticallandscapewasevidentsimplybylookingatthewallstheareaisstatusasanelectoralhotspotmeantitsplasteredboundariesremainedavibrantcanvasforchikamarathetermlocalsusedforgraffitievenafterthedownfallofautocracywiththeadventoftechnologythesewerereplacedbyposterssometimesmakingtheirpointinsimpletopographyandattimeswithgrotesqueimageriesofthingsdonewrongtopeoplewithopposingviewsofcoursegraffiticameinthelimelightonceagainafterthefallofthehasinaregimetheslogansthistimewerenotjustpoliticalbutattimesdeeplypersonalturningeverybrickintoabulletinboardofpublicdissentinmyteensibegantonoticethingsmoreseriouslyoneofthemorefamiliarsightsbackthenwasthecrowdthatgatheredaroundwallswithdailynewspapersgluedontheplasterhereyoudidnotjustreadtheheadlinesyoualsogotunsolicitedcommentaryfromthepersonbesideyouandaregulardoseofconspiracytheoriesfromanalystsnowinmymidfortiesispotofficegoersdressedincrispshirtspressedtrousersandformalshoespausingatthesamecornersjottingdownbitsofinformationfastforwardtothesthewallshasembracednewmessagesthenewspapersectionisgoneandateveryturnyouwillfindflyersofferingroomsforrentnosurprisestherebutthereisacatchthetoletnoticesrarelyadvertisefullapartmentsanymoreinsteadtheyseektenantsforsingleroomsorsharedmessseatsataffordablepricestheadsaresimplenofrillsjustabrieflineandaphonenumbersomeareformenonlyothersforfemalesandeverynowandthenyoucomeacrossasigndeclaringonlyfamilywithsuchurgencyitfeelslikethewallitselfisshoutingbachelorsnotwelcomeamidstthesealiethecuriousrenegadeadvertisementsfortheproverbialghotokmatchmakersandtheirmoderndaycompetitionmatrimonialwebsitesthereisalsotheposterforthekazigovernmentendorsedagentswhoscribesthemaritaldocumentthekabinnamaishudderatthethoughtofthetantriksadhumakinghisappearancepromisingcuretomaritaldiscordandalotofearthlyproblemsofcoursetherearealsotherunofthemilladvertisementsofcoachingcentresfromofferingtopreparingstudentsformadrassasandcadetcollegestomedicalanduniversityadmissionseveryinchofwallspaceseemstobetakensomepromisemiracleieltsscoresinjustthreemonthsresultsthatseemachievablebynonebutthemostproficientinenglishotherspromiseyoutoteachkoreanatfarmgateandthenthereareremnantsofadvertisingtrendsthatnevercaughtonthemanobotardewalinitiativelaunchedduringthepandemicencouragedresidentstohangtheirusedclothesonthewallsforthelessfortunatetotakenowonlythewordsandhooksremainremindingusthatinacitythathasnowturnedcoldhumanitymakesacomebackonlyintimesofperilihavealwaysbelievedthatyoucanmeasuretheeconomicconditionofaneighbourhoodbythestoriesitswallsshareandinshantinagaritisclearthatthehardrealitiesoflifeareleavingitsmarkafterallitisnolongeranaffluentpartofthecitynowmostlycalledhomebytheburgeoningmiddleclassthemodesttimewornwallscallupontheresidentsofthislocalitytoheartheirstoriesandwhiledoingsoechothevoicesoftheverypeoplethattheythemselveswerebuilttoguardpsinawaythewallshavenowmovedonlinefacebookgroupsandmessengerthreadsdedicatedtoshantinagararenowplasteredwiththesamenoticestuitionadslostandfoundannouncementsforcatspestcontrolandcoachingcentrepromotionsitisasifthewallshavetakentotheinternetandstillscreamingjustasloudlyeabeaeaaeabeeabeaaeabeaeabeaeaceabeeaaeabfeafeaeabeaeaceabeeaaeaeafeaaeabfeabeabeeaaaeaaealaughingeaaeabeeaaceabfeaealaughingeaaeabfeaaeabeafeabeaeaaeabeeaaceabeeabeabfeaaeaeafeaaeeaaeaeabeaaeabeaaceabfeabeafeaeabeaaeealaughingeaaaeaeaealaughingeaaeabeaaceaeaaeabeeaa
"Mostofa Sarwar Farooki's leap from the cinematic world to the corridors of power hasn't been the smooth transition many may have imagined. Appointed as the Cultural Adviser to the interim government, the acclaimed filmmaker has found himself navigating a terrain riddled with scrutiny, expectations, and ideological fault lines. In this exclusive interview, the Cultural Adviser opens up about the journey so far— the personal deliberations that preceded his appointment, the professional risks he knowingly took, and the vision he holds for Bangladesh's cultural future. Yet, behind the sharp public figure, we find a man who still misses the intimacy of the film set—where the only politics involved were those of plot and character. How do you feel after taking charge of the Ministry of Cultural Affairs, especially being a part of the interim government? Any new responsibility brings with it a few feel-good moments, but challenges are waiting just around the corner. I never truly aspired to hold public office. When the offer came, my first thought wasn't policy or power—but family. I knew this would affect Tisha and our family dynamics. Even though we usually keep work discussions to a minimum, I felt I had to speak to her. Her immediate response was 'no', and mine echoed hers. What actually convinced you then? Although I picked up the phone to inform the Chief Adviser Professor Dr Mohammad Yunus, to let him know of my decision to decline, that conversation took an unexpected turn.  I told to myself 'I probably have a responsibility to work for rebuilding as I was also part of a huge population who wanted to see the end of Hasina's fascist rule.' I felt July has given us a responsibility and I should respond to that although I knew it's going to put me in a very uncomfortable position.  I was aware that accepting this role would alienate me from some people. But after the oath, I realised it wasn't just one group—I'd triggered discontent in multiple directions. Still, you remained resolute…
 Because I knew we have a responsibility to give a new cultural direction which will include different ideas, ethnic groups, and religions. We knew we have a huge job in hand and it's not going to happen easily.  How challenging has your journey been so far? During 17 years of past bureaucracy, there have been many weak appointments and a great deal of nepotism. I'm having to work within a horribly designed system. Within this bureaucracy, we have both capable employees and incompetent ones. Some are genuinely committed to change and improvement, while others actively slow down our progress. That in itself is a huge challenge. In addition, there are undeniable challenges that come from differing social opinions post uprising. July uprising saw many differing groups come together with one goal. When that goal was achieved, quite understandably, the ideological differences of these groups have started to come to the surface. Everyone who participated in the uprising, in any capacity, believes the country should run ONLY the way they want it to. So, we needed to be extremely aware of the sensitivity. At the same time, we needed to be absolutely resolute about what we want to achieve. It's a tough act of keeping things balanced.  You're only the second person from showbiz in Bangladesh's history to lead the Ministry of Cultural Affairs to date. Do you think it's genuinely beneficial for someone from the cultural field to head this ministry? It is undoubtedly important for someone from the cultural sphere to be in charge of this ministry, as such a person is more likely to be aware of what is happening in that sector. They understand the existing challenges and are better positioned to address them. However, I also believe that this doesn't always guarantee success. Much depends on the individual in charge — their depth of understanding, both at the macro and micro levels, and their vision about the nation's cultural identity and goals. The person also needs to have a clear idea about creative economy and the growth of cultural industry.  You previously brought up about a 'broader aspect' of the cultural sector. Could you elaborate on that?
 The common idea about the Ministry of Culture is- oh, it's about entertainment industry. But in reality, its responsibilities stretch far broader. Of course, cultural industry is our prime focus although our ministerial allocation of business makes it difficult to take proper care of our cultural industry which I will discuss later.  On the macro level, the ministry has a vital role to play in shaping ideas of inclusion within society. It carries an enormous responsibility. When this ministry is misdirected, it can give rise to political tensions. The depth of such cultural mismanagement has contributed to 16 years of oppression, culminating in the uprising we saw in July. That's why I believe the July movement was primarily a cultural phenomenon, a manifestation of cultural rage. With the national budget approaching, the cultural community is calling for at least one percent of the total allocation to go to the cultural sector. In your view, is this a realistic and justified demand? To me, the minimum allocation should be four percent. I also think the entire scope of the Ministry of Culture's work needs to be completely redefined. The country's entire cultural industry — film, television, OTT platforms, music, theatre, photography, and new media — all of it should fall under one unified industry. The entire gamut of art education should also come under the ministry like they have in Korea and many countries who are doing brilliant with their creative economy. Only then, we will be able to formulate a proper action plan for the creative industry and people related to the industry.  If you were granted a portion of the national budget, how would you prioritise its use? Music is Bangladesh's biggest cultural asset. If we have to brand Bangladesh globally, it has to be with music. Think of the enormous variety we have in our music. Even if we get one percent, our primary focus should be mapping the music landscape of the entire country. Next, we should develop a program in order to facilitate a huge music archive which will not only project Bangladesh globally as a land of music, but will also earn revenue for the artistes. We are already developing two programmes around music- one deals with music schools and the other with the rich musical variety of Bangladesh. This shall include people from not just Bangalees, but all ethnic groups. The second priority will be to complete meaningful reforms of the Shilpakala Academy and museums – which are in terrible conditions by the way. Much like our museums, our archaeological department is also not properly functioning. We have failed to take inspiration from the world, and never tried to know how archaeological sites are being presented to in a modern way. It's not enough to just have a beautiful site.  At this time, we are just highlighting the needs and creating a blueprint for reforms. However, we have at least targeted one archaeological site and trying to do something during our tenure. We are trying to turn Panam Nagar into a living city of arts, craft, and gastronomy -- and turn it into a must-visit place for the people of the world if we can plan things properly. We are already discussing this internally.    In addition, we are formulating a new cultural policy upon which our next action plans should be based on. An expert committee is already evaluating policies from different countries and working on making a draft for us. If we had longer tenure, we would have targeted bringing the entire cultural industry into one umbrella and form a five-year action plan with a set of achievable goals.  The film industry is still under the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting…
 It makes no sense, and I have said this so many times. However, it is a long procedure, and without an elected body of government with a longer tenure, it is not possible to bring that change in ministerial allocation of business.  Could you explain how all cultural wings under one umbrella would be beneficial? If that happens, we'll be able to map the current state of our creative sector — who is working where, what kind of support the government is providing, how our private sector is performing in terms of economic growth. Quality work will emerge not just from direct government initiatives, but also through motivation and indirect support. I believe that's essential. Also, as I mentioned earlier, all educational institutions related to art should also come under this ministry. This would help us track how many students are emerging from the sector, where they're coming from, whether they're receiving proper education, and what curriculum changes are needed to prepare them for the job market. Right now, we lack that structure. Wouldn't that be a time-consuming process?
 Of course! That's why I mentioned about remaining practical in selecting targets. What I've just outlined is a vision that would require five to ten years to implement. Since that's beyond our current term, we're working on shaping these ideas into a blueprint, which we will publish publicly before we leave, so that those who come through democratic elections can choose to take it forward. Frankly speaking, I've prepared the plan considering a December timeline, so that I wouldn't take on any impractical projects. We've tried to identify what can realistically be done within this limited time. What, in your opinion, have you been able to achieve so far during your time in this role? One cannot expect huge reforms in such a short time, but I think signs of change are already visible. You can clearly see a paradigm shift in the state's cultural policy. From small things like a show at UNESCO or OSACA Expo to this year's Noboborsho celebrations, you can feel the change. For the first time in the history of Bangladesh, all ethnic groups have been included in the new year rally at Dhaka. Rock bands from different ethnic groups were included in the line-up of biggest ever Chaitra Shongkranti concert. They were not included as tokens, but were rather treated respectfully and given prime-time slots. An additional day of holiday was declared, which was a valid demand of many different ethnic groups in Bangladesh. This country is for everyone.  Another longstanding issue we've faced is the false binary between religion and culture—especially the tendency to treat Islamic culture as something separate from mainstream cultural identity. This division, we believe, has contributed to a deep political crisis. That's why, from the outset, we've been focusing on two foundational ideas—'cultural inclusion' and 'cultural healing'. This process is already underway, and we're already witnessing its impact gradually. Take Chand Raat, for example—the night before Eid. This year, a celebratory programme was held at the Bangladesh Shilpakala Academy, followed by an Eid rally. Some critics were quick to accuse us of pandering to Islamists. But to put things in perspective, this year's Buddha Purnima was celebrated not just in Dhaka but in three major districts. For Eid, the Ministry of Culture released a TV commercial on the Chief Adviser's official page, and similarly, a Buddha Purnima TVC—directed by a young filmmaker from their community—was released in the same way. These are clear markers of inclusion. You'll see similar efforts for Durga Puja and Christmas as well. The tenure of Jamil Ahmed at Bangladesh Shilpakala Academy (BSA) has come to an end controversially, yet no new Director General has been appointed. What are the Ministry's plans for BSA?
 Despite the absence of a regular DG, BSA has remained remarkably active during this new year's celebration. At the same time, it needs to be mentioned BSA needs a major reform and restructuring. We have been working on forming a reform committee as soon as possible, just so it can become a modern art space for all disciplines and can cater to today's needs. While the reform committee works on the much-needed engine overhaul, a new DG will definitely be appointed. We are looking forward to someone who can lead the organisation with maturity.  When are we getting a new DG? We've shortlisted a few candidates. However, whoever takes on the role must be open-minded — someone who is curious about all art forms and mediums, aware of global trends, and understands how different forms of art are flourishing around the world. We're looking for someone who isn't confined to just one world or perspective. At the same time, the person needs to have administrative and leadership qualities. Without this, it's going to make it difficult. Let's see. First let's form the reform committee as soon as possible.  We're witnessing a wave of 'wholesale' charges being brought against artistes, including serious accusations like murder. As someone regarded as a guardian of the cultural community, can you guarantee professional safety for artists who hold differing political views or beliefs? And I absolutely do not support the practice of filing wholesale or blanket charges. It's deeply troubling. If there are legitimate, specific allegations against someone or a group, then legal action can and should be taken against the individuals directly involved. But accusing someone of a crime they had no proven connection to—say, linking them to an unrelated murder—is unacceptable. Allegations must be specific and grounded in evidence. No one—be it the President, Prime Minister, or minister or artiste—is above the law. If someone commits a crime, they must face legal consequences. But using the law to intimidate or suppress dissent is equally wrong. Concerts were being postponed, theatre performances cancelled, and actresses harassed at opening events—often attributed to the actions of so-called ""special groups"". Why hasn't there been a strong and decisive response to stop these incidents?
 After the mass uprising and initially after the interim took charge, the police and administration were effectively non-functional. In that vacuum, some incidents happened as we all know.  What really matters is how the state responds to those incidents. For example, every Baul concert that had been shut down subsequently took place. We must avoid making sweeping generalisations. This year, despite everything, the cultural celebrations during Chaitra Shongkranti and Pahela Baishakh were held on an unprecedented scale. People across the country have said they've never seen such mass participation before. What does that tell us? Bangladesh is a multicultural, multi-religious melting pot. It has always been this way, and it will remain so. Three journalists were reportedly sacked for asking you questions. Do you have anything to say about this? First of all, I personally am fully respectful of the personal freedom of expression. Our government is clear about its stance on journalistic freedom.  I humbly submit that no one lost their jobs for questioning me. For instance, there was a very controversial question about my wife, Nusrat Imrose Tisha, and her role in the Mujib biopic. Did the journalist who asked that question face any consequences? Absolutely not. As for the three journalists now being talked about—they asked me their questions, and I responded directly at the time. For me, that issue ended right there. What happened afterwards— the online backlash and public reaction— was driven by those who participated in the uprising and by the families of the victims of July. As far as I remember, the participants of the movements and the families of the shaheeds were shocked because the question of whether Hasina was a proven killer was raised. July is still fresh in people's memories. It hurt them deeply. But we don't know why the three media outlets removed them. Neither I or the government support such sackings—it's uncomfortable and regrettable. I have called upon newspapers immediately after to investigate if there was any influence, direct or indirect, from the government.  On a lighter note, do you miss direction?
 I miss it tremendously. I always knew that taking on this responsibility would put my filmmaking career at serious risk. Many would turn against me—but I have always followed my conscience, doing only what I believed was right. The biggest sacrifice since stepping into this role has been my last directorial project, ""840 aka Democracy PVT LTD"". I truly consider it one of my strongest political satires. But when it was released, it didn't find its audience. Right away, there was a right-wing campaign accusing me of sympathizing with fascists. Simultaneously, the Awami League launched their own campaign against me. Caught in this political storm, the film suffered greatly—it became a target of attacks and was largely neglected. But I expected this from the start. Still, I have no regrets because I'm confident ""840"" will be recognised for its value, even if it takes five years. I especially miss directing—being on set. For me, filmmaking is inherently political—at least the kind of films I make. So, everything I say or do often sparks controversy. Being outspoken on social media made me a frequent target, and that has likely impacted the mindset of my audience as well. Some people may decide not to watch my film just because I didn't subscribe to their ideology, or to be precise, I stood against that. Sometimes I wonder—would it have been better if I'd stayed silent on social media and just kept making films quietly? However next moment, I tell to myself 'If it's right for any artist to keep quiet in the face of a mass-killing just because it might cost him some loyal audiences? Before becoming Minister of Culture, you led another ministry—Chorki's 'Ministry of Love'. We haven't heard any updates from that ministry.
 Since I am not able to see anything about it, Tisha is looking after that. What is the current stage of the Monsoon Revolution project? Eight workshops are complete, but progress on the films has slowed down a bit. Due to bureaucratic procedures, there's been a delay in fund transfers. It will take some time—things will start coming in gradually, one by one. Many are also asking — now that there are no obstacles and you're in power, why aren't you releasing 'Saturday Afternoon'?
 The film is already available on OTT. The people who would watch the film has seen it in their own way. There's no freshness left in it anymore, so why would someone feel there is a potential market in theatres now? It already had theatrical releases in America and Canada. Do you intend to run in the upcoming election? Absolutely not — I'm a filmmaker. After the uprising, when the country called, I responded. However, I'll return to filmmaking and continue making films. However, if the next government feels the need for advice on the blueprint we leave behind, I'll certainly offer my support. After all, I'm a stakeholder in this country. If I'm called upon, of course I'll share my views.

"Renowned actor Afzal Hossain, known for his insightful commentary on social issues, often shares his reflections through eloquent and thought-provoking writing. Without directly naming individuals, he subtly critiques current societal concerns, weaving his observations with meticulous care and sharp language. As the country grapples with growing inequality and increasingly polarized views on social reform, Hossain highlights the hypocrisy of those who choose to defame the nation while still living within it. In his view, patriotism today is being reduced to mere declarations rather than meaningful action. He draws attention to individuals who vocally criticise the government yet make no effort to support or improve the systems that serve the people. Here is the full text of Afzal Hossain's recent post:    ""We claim to love our country, yet it feels good to go around telling others that the nation is in crisis or heading toward a great disaster. There's a strange satisfaction in heating up the atmosphere with such talk. A sense of pleasure arises. It's a very peculiar kind of love. And this strange love keeps bringing calamities into our lives—yet we never learn. We remain the same. Just as some people feel relaxed after a full meal and let out a belch, some also feel the urge to make that sound heard by everyone, to show they've eaten well—that's bad manners, a kind of perversion. The way many people flaunt and broadcast their patriotism is quite similar to that belch. Is patriotism something that needs to be proven? A group of people wants to know how much patriotism lies within someone, judges it, and delivers a verdict. A farmer, while plowing the field, doesn't suddenly spread his arms wide and shout, 'I love my country!' He dreams big through his field and his harvest—that is his patriotism. The hardworking masses of this country toil endlessly. They're exhausted, struggling to find a way to survive. They have no time to ponder the spelling, meaning, benefits or drawbacks of patriotism. Their blood and sweat—through their very lives—express their love for the country. They don't need to say it aloud: 'I love my country, I love my country.' A kind of 'patriotic' society has emerged—one that constantly seeks out crises in the nation, problems in governance, and talks about them. 'This isn't working, why hasn't that happened, this person's role is questionable, does that person even care about the country?' They throw around dozens of such questions to stir the pot. That heats up the crowd, and once the crowd is stirred, one can become the center of attention—fame and influence begin to rise rapidly. They carefully choose topics that will raise public anxiety—then sprinkle salt, onion, green chilies and more into the mix to whip up a delicious dish. And a large group waits eagerly every day for a serving of that tasty dish. Many of us enjoy being agitated and spreading agitation—but it brings no peace, no real comfort. At times, it feels like those obsessed with the thrill of hunting have turned the country into a muddy pond. In that murky water, there's chaos—shouting, diving, scrambling—by a hundred and one fishermen. When they're out of breath, fights break out—leading to scuffles and brawls. Scuffles and brawls have become part of our version of patriotism. Blaming others without understanding or knowledge is also considered patriotism. It's like that story of two dogs fighting over a bone—while they bit and wrestled each other, a crow swooped in and flew away with the bone. So many times, even after winning, we repeatedly lose to some crow. Even a person with the slightest wisdom should realize that if we truly want the country to prosper, we need to bring clarity to our own minds, show some restraint, make small sacrifices, and practice patience. We need to hope—and believe—that the country will be better tomorrow than it is today. Illness is cured with medicine and treatment—but the patient must also believe, must want to get better. Keeping faith in the heart is also a kind of medicine. A strong-minded person doesn't easily break down in adversity. It is the weak, those without inner strength, who surrender at the mere mention of battle. Because we keep responding to the call of the path that leads to defeat and fear, we fail to hear the call of the path that leads to the lion's gate."" সেনাসদর আরও জানিয়েছে, জাতীয় নিরাপত্তা বিঘ্নিত হয়, সেনাবাহিনী এমন কোনো বিষয়ে সম্পৃক্ত হবে না।",2025-05-26T10:56:51Z,renownedactorafzalhossainknownforhisinsightfulcommentaryonsocialissuesoftenshareshisreflectionsthrougheloquentandthoughtprovokingwritingwithoutdirectlynamingindividualshesubtlycritiquescurrentsocietalconcernsweavinghisobservationswithmeticulouscareandsharplanguageasthecountrygrappleswithgrowinginequalityandincreasinglypolarizedviewsonsocialreformhossainhighlightsthehypocrisyofthosewhochoosetodefamethenationwhilestilllivingwithinitinhisviewpatriotismtodayisbeingreducedtomeredeclarationsratherthanmeaningfulactionhedrawsattentiontoindividualswhovocallycriticisethegovernmentyetmakenoefforttosupportorimprovethesystemsthatservethepeoplehereisthefulltextofafzalhossainisrecentpostcaweclaimtoloveourcountryyetitfeelsgoodtogoaroundtellingothersthatthenationisincrisisorheadingtowardagreatdisasterthereisastrangesatisfactioninheatinguptheatmospherewithsuchtalkasenseofpleasurearisesitisaverypeculiarkindofloveandthisstrangelovekeepsbringingcalamitiesintoourliveseyetweneverlearnweremainthesamejustassomepeoplefeelrelaxedafterafullmealandletoutabelchsomealsofeeltheurgetomakethatsoundheardbyeveryonetoshowtheyhaveeatenwellethatisbadmannersakindofperversionthewaymanypeopleflauntandbroadcasttheirpatriotismisquitesimilartothatbelchispatriotismsomethingthatneedstobeprovenagroupofpeoplewantstoknowhowmuchpatriotismlieswithinsomeonejudgesitanddeliversaverdictafarmerwhileplowingthefielddoesnotsuddenlyspreadhisarmswideandshoutilovemycountryhedreamsbigthroughhisfieldandhisharvestethatishispatriotismthehardworkingmassesofthiscountrytoilendlesslytheyareexhaustedstrugglingtofindawaytosurvivetheyhavenotimetoponderthespellingmeaningbenefitsordrawbacksofpatriotismtheirbloodandsweatethroughtheirveryliveseetonguestickingoutresstheirloveforthecountrytheydonotneedtosayitaloutonguestickingoutilovemycountryilovemycountryakindofpatrioticsocietyhasemergedeonethatconstantlyseeksoutcrisesinthenationproblemsingovernanceandtalksaboutthemnothisisnotworkingwhyhasnotthathappenedthispersonisroleisquestionabledoesthatpersonevencareaboutthecountrytheythrowarounddozensofsuchquestionstostirthepotthatheatsupthecrowdandoncethecrowdisstirredonecanbecomethecenterofattentionefameandinfluencebegintoriserapidlytheycarefullychoosetopicsthatwillraisepublicanxietyethensprinklesaltoniongreenchiliesandmoreintothemixtowhipupadeliciousdishandalargegroupwaitseagerlyeverydayforaservingofthattastydishmanyofusenjoybeingagitatedandspreadingagitationebutitbringsnopeacenorealcomfortattimesitfeelslikethoseobsessedwiththethrillofhuntinghaveturnedthecountryintoamuddypondinthatmurkywaterthereischaoseshoutingdivingscramblingebyahundredandonefishermenwhentheyareoutofbreathfightsbreakouteleadingtoscufflesandbrawlsscufflesandbrawlshavebecomepartofourversionofpatriotismblamingotherswithoutunderstandingorknowledgeisalsoconsideredpatriotismitislikethatstoryoftwodogsfightingoveraboneewhiletheybitandwrestledeachotheracrowswoopedinandflewawaywiththebonesomanytimesevenafterwinningwerepeatedlylosetosomecrowevenapersonwiththeslightestwisdomshouldrealizethatifwetrulywantthecountrytoprosperweneedtobringclaritytoourownmindsshowsomerestraintmakesmallsacrificesandpracticepatienceweneedtohopeeandbelieveethatthecountrywillbebettertomorrowthanitistodayillnessiscuredwithmedicineandtreatmentebutthepatientmustalsobelievemustwanttogetbetterkeepingfaithintheheartisalsoakindofmedicineastrongmindedpersondoesnoteasilybreakdowninadversityitistheweakthosewithoutinnerstrengthwhosurrenderatthemerementionofbattlebecausewekeeprespondingtothecallofthepaththatleadstodefeatandfearwefailtohearthecallofthepaththatleadstothelionisgateeabeaeaaeabeeabeaaeabeaeabeaeaceabeeaaeabfeafeaeabeaeaceabeeaaeaeafeaaeabfeabeabeeaaaeaaealaughingeaaeabeeaaceabfeaealaughingeaaeabfeaaeabeafeabeaeaaeabeeaaceabeeabeabfeaaeaeafeaaeeaaeaeabeaaeabeaaceabfeabeafeaeabeaaeealaughingeaaaeaeaealaughingeaaeabeaaceaeaaeabeeaa
"Popular magazine show ""Ityadi"", written, directed, and hosted by Hanif Sanket, returns this month with a new episode shot in the southwestern district of Jhenaidah, often referred to as the gateway to southern Bangladesh. The episode is set to air on Bangladesh Television (BTV) at 8 pm on Friday (May 30), following the 8 pm Bangla news bulletin. The shooting of the episode faced several challenges due to inclement weather. Despite storms, rain, and muddy roads, thousands of enthusiastic audience members made their way to the venue at night, eager to catch a glimpse of their beloved host.  This episode features a folk song based on the lyrics and melodies of legendary local poet Pagla Kanai, performed by singers Selim Chowdhury and Tasiba. The music was directed by Mehedi. Singer Monir Khan, a native of Jhenaidah, lends his voice to another track composed by Kishore Das and penned by lyricist Mohammad Rafiquzzaman. The show opens with a song introducing Jhenaidah, written by Moniruzzaman Palash of Shailkupa and performed by over a hundred local dancers. The choreography was done by Mohammad Shahin Islam, with vocals by Rajib and Tanzina Ruma. The melody was composed by Hanif Sanket himself. A popular segment featured an interactive quiz session, from which four audience members were selected to act in a short drama centred around Jhenaidah's signature products—banana and betel leaf—performed in the local dialect. The episode also includes several touching reports, including a segment on Jhenaidah's history, a feature on the renowned Dattnagar Agricultural Farm—one of Asia's largest seed production centres—and profiles of several notable personalities from the region. As always, ""Ityadi"" brings a series of socially-conscious comedic sketches addressing contemporary issues. Among the dramas featured in this episode are: ""Poster Nirjaton"", ""Dalaler Dourattyo"", ""Swabhav Sanskar"", ""Probad-Prabachoner Pichoner Golpo"", ""Facebooker Sangbad Seba"", ""Shasthyer Byabsha"", ""Pashu-Pakhi Preeti"", ""Naam Sankote Dol Gothon"", ""Dosh Khuje Dosh Dhora"", and ""Kotha Shune Oytha Byatha"". This episode of ""Ityadi"" features a wide ensemble cast, including Babul Ahmed, Abdullah Rana, Abdul Aziz, Subhashish Bhowmik, Amin Azad, Anjuman Ara Shirin, Rocky Khan, Zillur Rahman, Kamal Bayezid, Mukit Zakaria, Zahid Shikder, Ashraful Alam Sohag, Anwar Shahi, Nazrul Islam, Ananda Khaled, Suman Patoary, Shahed Ali, Sujat Shimul, Tarik Swapan, Anwarul Alam Sajal, Saidur Rahman Pavel, Belal Ahmed Murad, Monjur Alam, Bilu Barua, Matiur Rahman, Rajib Salehin, Sadia Tanjin, Sabrina Nisa, and Surbana Majumdar, among others. The episode will also include the show's regular segments. সেনাসদর আরও জানিয়েছে, জাতীয় নিরাপত্তা বিঘ্নিত হয়, সেনাবাহিনী এমন কোনো বিষয়ে সম্পৃক্ত হবে না।",2025-05-26T06:27:42Z,popularmagazineshowityadiwrittendirectedandhostedbyhanifsanketreturnsthismonthwithanewepisodeshotinthesouthwesterndistrictofjhenaidahoftenreferredtoasthegatewaytosouthernbangladeshtheepisodeissettoaironbangladeshtelevisionbtvatpmonfridaymayfollowingthepmbanglanewsbulletintheshootingoftheepisodefacedseveralchallengesduetoinclementweatherdespitestormsrainandmuddyroadsthousandsofenthusiasticaudiencemembersmadetheirwaytothevenueatnighteagertocatchaglimpseoftheirbelovedhostthisepisodefeaturesafolksongbasedonthelyricsandmelodiesoflegendarylocalpoetpaglakanaiperformedbysingersselimchowdhuryandtasibathemusicwasdirectedbymehedisingermonirkhananativeofjhenaidahlendshisvoicetoanothertrackcomposedbykishoredasandpennedbylyricistmohammadrafiquzzamantheshowopenswithasongintroducingjhenaidahwrittenbymoniruzzamanpalashofshailkupaandperformedbyoverahundredlocaldancersthechoreographywasdonebymohammadshahinislamwithvocalsbyrajibandtanzinarumathemelodywascomposedbyhanifsankethimselfapopularsegmentfeaturedaninteractivequizsessionfromwhichfouraudiencememberswereselectedtoactinashortdramacentredaroundjhenaidahissignatureproductsebananaandbetelleafeperformedinthelocaldialecttheepisodealsoincludesseveraltouchingreportsincludingasegmentonjhenaidahishistoryafeatureontherenowneddattnagaragriculturalfarmeoneofasiaislargestseedproductioncentreseandprofilesofseveralnotablepersonalitiesfromtheregionasalwaysityadibringsaseriesofsociallyconsciouscomedicsketchesaddressingcontemporaryissuesamongthedramasfeaturedinthisepisodeareposternirjatondalalerdourattyoswabhavsanskarprobadprabachonerpichonergolpofacebookersangbadsebashasthyerbyabshapashupakhipreetinaamsankotedolgothondoshkhujedoshdhoraandkothashuneoythabyathathisepisodeofityadifeaturesawideensemblecastincludingbabulahmedabdullahranaabdulazizsubhashishbhowmikaminazadanjumanarashirinrockykhanzillurrahmankamalbayezidmukitzakariazahidshikderashrafulalamsohaganwarshahinazrulislamanandakhaledsumanpatoaryshahedalisujatshimultarikswapananwarulalamsajalsaidurrahmanpavelbelalahmedmuradmonjuralambilubaruamatiurrahmanrajibsalehinsadiatanjinsabrinanisaandsurbanamajumdaramongotherstheepisodewillalsoincludetheshowisregularsegmentseabeaeaaeabeeabeaaeabeaeabeaeaceabeeaaeabfeafeaeabeaeaceabeeaaeaeafeaaeabfeabeabeeaaaeaaealaughingeaaeabeeaaceabfeaealaughingeaaeabfeaaeabeafeabeaeaaeabeeaaceabeeabeabfeaaeaeafeaaeeaaeaeabeaaeabeaaceabfeabeafeaeabeaaeealaughingeaaaeaeaealaughingeaaeabeaaceaeaaeabeeaa
"When will the day come when Hindus, Muslims, Buddhists, and Christians
  no longer cling to caste or creed?
  When will such a human society be born—
  a world free from division and prejudice? – Lalon Draped in a simple white saree—an emblem of spiritual purity—Suchona Shely stood in quiet devotion within the studio, her two companions by her side: the ektara and duggi. The saree, unadorned yet luminous, reflected the inner simplicity of Baul life—a life stripped of ego, bound not by ritual but by love for the Divine within. As Shely began to sing ""Emon Manush Shomaj"", a timeless Lalon geeti, her fingers gently awakened the ektara's string, while the heartbeat of the duggi echoed the yearning in her voice. It was not merely a song—it was a prayer. A cry for unity, for boundless love, for a world freed from the chains of creed, caste, and division. For Shely, a devoted Baul singer from the village of Lakshmipur, music is not performance—it is prayer. Her father, Abdul Jolil Sordar, a Sadhu, always hoped that one of his daughters would become a Sadhu. Shely answered that call. At the tender age of six, she renounced meat—and even eggs—embracing a life guided by the Baul ideals of detachment, purity, and love for the Divine within. ""Living this way wasn't easy at first,"" Shely recalls. ""I don't even eat food prepared in utensils used for meat or eggs. People thought I must be Hindu because of that. It caused a lot of misunderstanding in the beginning."" But over time, something changed. Her quiet consistency began to speak louder than the assumptions. ""My village saw how I lived—with peace and simplicity. And slowly, their attitudes shifted,"" she reflects. ""Now, they see things differently."" Today, the people of Lakshmipur, refer to Shely's home as an ashram—a sanctuary of spirit. ""Each year, on December 15, we host a Sadhu Songo—a gathering of sadhus and seekers,"" she shares. Yet Lakshmipur, was not always a place for spiritual music. ""There was no tradition of song here. But now they would always ask me 6 months prior to the event when it will start as those are the times that they get to see so many sadhus at the same time,"" she says. ""My ashram stands right beside a mosque—literally side by side. In today's Bangladesh, music near mosques is often seen as unimaginable, even forbidden. But I am deeply grateful that such conflict does not live here."" ""Lalon Shah spoke the language of truth,"" Shely continued. ""If someone can present that truth properly—and if I can help people understand that divinity resides in melody—then that's what truly matters. If we can express this with love, I believe there's no room left for conflict."" And yet, despite her growing recognition, Shely resists being called a 'shilpi' (artist). ""If you listen to Lalon's song ""Shotto Bol, Shupothe Chol"" and truly understand just those lines—then you need nothing else,"" she says. ""No rituals. No practices. Just the essence. Today, we often dress up songs with visuals and movements, but true music must be felt from within."" ""Lalon Shah's words are not just lyrics—for me they are the truth. How can we turn truth into a spectacle? I don't wish to be a guru. I don't even wish to be a shilpi. I only want to be a servant—an eternal devotee of the Sadhu guru. That is enough for me."" All through her childhood, she explored every instrument she could find: the harmonium, mondira, ektara, duggi, dotara. ""I tried them all,"" she says. ""I've always been a devotee of Lalon sai. And to truly carry his message, one must connect with his roots—through his instruments"". For Shely, the ektara and duggi are not just tools of rhythm—they are vessels of transmission. ""These are the sounds that carried Lalon's words through the wind, from one seeker to another,"" she reflects. ""Even today, you'll find many male sadhu-fakirs playing them. But for artistes of my generation, especially women, singing with just the ektara and duggi seems almost unimaginable."" Beyond live performances, Suchona Shely has lent her voice to films in both Bangladesh and Kolkata, and appeared in Coke Studio with Fuad for the track ""Dewana"". ""My first song with SVF was a fusion of Rabindranath Tagore and Lalon Shah's words,"" she recalls. ""Later, they invited me to sing a Rabindra Sangeet despite being a lalon singer. They felt I was the right choice for ""Tumi Khushi Thako"", and the audience loved it."" Reflecting on her Coke Studio experience, she recalls, ""For 'Dewana', it was Arnob da who insisted I join. He was familiar with my work and felt I needed to be part of the song."" Shely has also lent her voice in Aranyo Anawer's film 'Maa' and contributed two songs to 'Nakshi Kanthar Jamin'. While Baul sangeet still resonates across the rural heartlands, its essence seems to be slipping from the grasp of the younger generation. ""My father first introduced me to Lalon Sai's teachings—he was a follower himself,"" Shely shares. ""But today, many young people don't even speak Bangla fluently. To them, I would say: listen to Bangla, love the language, and learn it with your heart. Without that, it becomes almost impossible to truly understand Baul philosophy. Baul songs are woven in Shadhu bhasha. It demands not just education, but deep intellectual and spiritual insight."" ""There must be more research on Baul sangeet. Scholars, thinkers—our brightest minds—should write about Lalon sai in ways that touch both the mind and the soul. We need a book, a path, a subject that brings Lalon's message to every doorstep,"" added the singer. ""Let 100 sadhus speak—not of dogma, but of love. Let their words be heard across the world, in a time when hatred and division tear us apart. This war—between Hindu, Muslim, Buddhist—it is heartbreaking. Despite all these labels, the greatest religion is humanity. And until we live by that, we remain strangers to ourselves,"" stated Shely. সেনাসদর আরও জানিয়েছে, জাতীয় নিরাপত্তা বিঘ্নিত হয়, সেনাবাহিনী এমন কোনো বিষয়ে সম্পৃক্ত হবে

"Singer and actor Demi Lovato has tied the knot with Canadian musician Jordan ""Jutes"" Lutes in a private ceremony held on Sunday (May 25) in California. According to Vogue, which had exclusive coverage of the event, the wedding took place around 4 pm (Pacific Time). Lovato wore a custom pearl-white Vivienne Westwood gown made from heavy silk satin, complete with a corset bodice and a cathedral-style ivory tulle veil. A long-time admirer of the British label, Lovato noted that Westwood's iconic corsetry ""compliment[s] the curves in your body."" Following the ceremony, the ""Heart Attack"" singer changed into another Vivienne Westwood creation—""The Audrey""—an ivory silk satin column dress with a draped corset bodice and strands of hand-applied pearls, reflecting a modern take on old-Hollywood glamour. The wedding weekend was organised by renowned celebrity planner Mindy Weiss. Rehearsal photos from Saturday (May 24), released earlier by TMZ, had hinted at the intimate celebration. Lovato and Lutes first met in 2022 while working on her album ""Holy Fvck"", with Lutes co-writing multiple songs. The couple got engaged in December 2023, with Lutes proposing with a pear-shaped diamond ring. The wedding marks a significant chapter in their relationship, which Lovato has described as the ""best years"" of her life. সেনাসদর আরও জানিয়েছে, জাতীয় নিরাপত্তা বিঘ্নিত হয়, সেনাবাহিনী এমন কোনো বিষয়ে সম্পৃক্ত হবে না।",2025-05-26T05:25:29Z,singerandactordemilovatohastiedtheknotwithcanadianmusicianjordanjuteslutesinaprivateceremonyheldonsundaymayincaliforniaaccordingtovoguewhichhadexclusivecoverageoftheeventtheweddingtookplacearoundpmpacifictimelovatoworeacustompearlwhiteviviennewestwoodgownmadefromheavysilksatincompletewithacorsetbodiceandacathedralstyleivorytulleveilalongtimeadmirerofthebritishlabellovatonotedthatwestwoodisiconiccorsetrycomplimentsthecurvesinyourbodyfollowingtheceremonytheheartattacksingerchangedintoanotherviviennewestwoodcreationetheaudreyeanivorysilksatincolumndresswithadrapedcorsetbodiceandstrandsofhandappliedpearlsreflectingamoderntakeonoldhollywoodglamourtheweddingweekendwasorganisedbyrenownedcelebrityplannermindyweissrehearsalphotosfromsaturdaymayreleasedearlierbytmzhadhintedattheintimatecelebrationlovatoandlutesfirstmetinwhileworkingonheralbumholyfvckwithlutescowritingmultiplesongsthecouplegotengagedindecemberwithlutesproposingwithapearshapeddiamondringtheweddingmarksasignificantchapterintheirrelationshipwhichlovatohasdescribedasthebestyearsofherlifeeabeaeaaeabeeabeaaeabeaeabeaeaceabeeaaeabfeafeaeabeaeaceabeeaaeaeafeaaeabfeabeabeeaaaeaaealaughingeaaeabeeaaceabfeaealaughingeaaeabfeaaeabeafeabeaeaaeabeeaaceabeeabeabfeaaeaeafeaaeeaaeaeabeaaeabeaaceabfeabeafeaeabeaaeealaughingeaaaeaeaealaughingeaaeabeaaceaeaaeabeeaa
"Who could have ever imagined a boy making it to Cannes from the narrow, winding lanes in the outskirts of Noakhali? Certainly not Al Amin, not even in his wildest dreams. Nevertheless, that dream has now become a reality. ""Ali"", the short film directed by Adnan Al Rajeev, has received a Special Mention at the prestigious 78th Cannes Film Festival. Since Saturday, ""Ali"" has been on everyone's radar, celebrated for making history in the Bangladeshi film industry. With his deeply moving portrayal of the titular character, Al Amin is still trying to take it all in. ""I never even thought I'd act,"" he confessed, ""And now the opportunity of attending Cannes still feels like a dream."" The journey, he says, came out of nowhere, completely unplanned. Hailing from Bashirhat in Companiganj, Noakhali, Al Amin is a third-year BSS student at Govt Mujib College. While returning to Paris by train from Cannes, Al Amin reflected on the extraordinary path that took him from the quiet corners of rural Bangladesh to the glitz and grandeur of one of the world's most revered film festivals. For the role of Ali, director Adnan Al Rajeev had been searching for a certain kind of presence — an innocent face, someone with long hair and eyes expressive enough to speak volumes without uttering a word. ""They auditioned around 40 people for the part,"" Al Amin shared. ""But they weren't looking for someone to perform. They wanted someone who could simply be Ali. And they saw that in me."" So, how did they even find him — a complete newcomer with no media background? ""Well, I had auditioned for a few music reality shows,"" he explained. ""I got some attention for singing in dual voices, though I didn't have any formal training. I made it through the initial rounds but was eventually dropped because the others were far more polished."" It was through one of those interviews that the team from ""Ali"" noticed him. ""At first, I thought they were calling me for a YouTube fiction,"" he admitted. ""And I'd already decided I didn't want to do those anymore. But something told me to at least ask who the director was. When I found out it was Adnan Al Rajeev, I was stunned. I called them back immediately and said I'd come to Dhaka for the audition."" ""Last Friday, we watched the screening at the Claude Debussy Theatre beside the Festival Palace,"" Al Amin recounted. ""When the film ended, the entire audience stood up and clapped for ten straight minutes. It was overwhelming. I'll never forget it. If I hadn't seen it with my own eyes, I never would've believed that 'Ali' could move people like that. Afterward, people came up to me, took selfies, and told me how much they loved the film."" ""Ali"" is set in a coastal town, where singing is considered forbidden. A teenage boy, driven by his dreams, secretly enters a singing competition and longs to leave for the city. But beneath the surface lies a haunting mystery. About the director, he added warmly, ""Adnan bhai isn't just a brilliant director — he's a truly kind human being. He never criticises. Even if I wasn't getting something right, he'd say, 'You did well, but I think you can do even better.' That kind of support really gave me confidence."" Although ""Ali"" marked his very first acting experience, Al Amin believes it won't be his last. ""This film gave me a kind of courage I didn't know I had. I now truly believe I can build something with this."" The 23-year-old is full of gratitude for his family's support. ""My parents have always stood by me. People in my community might not know what Cannes is, but they know I went to France, and that alone makes them proud."" He was initially nervous about not speaking English fluently. ""But I soon realised that language isn't a barrier,"" he smiled. ""At the screening, people from France, Germany, and Japan came up to me and said, 'Your story moved us.' That's one of the greatest rewards I'll ever receive."" When he returns home, Al Amin plans to begin work on a full-length feature film. ""It'll be in our language, about our land and our people. I want the boys and girls from our villages to see themselves on screen — to hear their own stories."" At the 2025 Cannes Film Festival, the Short Film Palme d'Or was awarded to ""I'm Glad You're Dead Now"" by Tawfeek Barhom — who personally praised Al Amin's performance. ""I was overwhelmed when he came up to me and said he loved my work,"" he recalled while signing off. ""It felt surreal.""   সেনাসদর আরও জানিয়েছে, জাতীয় নিরাপত্তা বিঘ্নিত হয়, সেনাবাহিনী এমন কোনো বিষয়ে সম্পৃক্ত হবে না।",2025-05-25T13:07:31Z,whocouldhaveeverimaginedaboymakingittocannesfromthenarrowwindinglanesintheoutskirtsofnoakhalicertainlynotalaminnoteveninhiswildestdreamsneverthelessthatdreamhasnowbecomearealityalitheshortfilmdirectedbyadnanalrajeevhasreceivedaspecialmentionattheprestigiousthcannesfilmfestivalsincesaturdayalihasbeenoneveryoneisradarcelebratedformakinghistoryinthebangladeshifilmindustrywithhisdeeplymovingportrayalofthetitularcharacteralaminisstilltryingtotakeitallininevereventhoughtiwouldactheconfessedandnowtheopportunityofattendingcannesstillfeelslikeadreamthejourneyhesayscameoutofnowherecompletelyunplannedhailingfrombashirhatincompaniganjnoakhalialaminisathirdyearbssstudentatgovtmujibcollegewhilereturningtoparisbytrainfromcannesalaminreflectedontheextraordinarypaththattookhimfromthequietcornersofruralbangladeshtotheglitzandgrandeurofoneoftheworldismostreveredfilmfestivalsfortheroleofalidirectoradnanalrajeevhadbeensearchingforacertainkindofpresenceeaninnocentfacesomeonewithlonghairandeyesetonguestickingoutressiveenoughtospeakvolumeswithoututteringawordtheyauditionedaroundpeopleforthepartalaminsharedbuttheywerenotlookingforsomeonetoperformtheywantedsomeonewhocouldsimplybealiandtheysawthatinmesohowdidtheyevenfindhimeacompletenewcomerwithnomediabackgroundwellihadauditionedforafewmusicrealityshowsheetonguestickingoutlainedigotsomeattentionforsingingindualvoicesthoughididnothaveanyformaltrainingimadeitthroughtheinitialroundsbutwaseventuallydroppedbecausetheotherswerefarmorepolisheditwasthroughoneofthoseinterviewsthattheteamfromalinoticedhimatfirstithoughttheywerecallingmeforayoutubefictionheadmittedandiwouldalreadydecidedididnotwanttodothoseanymorebutsomethingtoldmetoatleastaskwhothedirectorwaswhenifoundoutitwasadnanalrajeeviwasstunnedicalledthembackimmediatelyandsaidiwouldcometodhakafortheauditionlastfridaywewatchedthescreeningattheclaudedebussytheatrebesidethefestivalpalacealaminrecountedwhenthefilmendedtheentireaudiencestoodupandclappedfortenstraightminutesitwasoverwhelmingiwillneverforgetitifihadnotseenitwithmyowneyesineverwouldhavebelievedthatalicouldmovepeoplelikethatafterwardpeoplecameuptometookselfiesandtoldmehowmuchtheylovedthefilmaliissetinacoastaltownwheresingingisconsideredforbiddenateenageboydrivenbyhisdreamssecretlyentersasingingcompetitionandlongstoleaveforthecitybutbeneaththesurfaceliesahauntingmysteryaboutthedirectorheaddedwarmlyadnanbhaiisnotjustabrilliantdirectoreheisatrulykindhumanbeinghenevercriticisesevenifiwasnotgettingsomethingrighthewouldsayyoudidwellbutithinkyoucandoevenbetterthatkindofsupportreallygavemeconfidencealthoughalimarkedhisveryfirstactingetonguestickingouteriencealaminbelievesitwillnotbehislastthisfilmgavemeakindofcourageididnotknowihadinowtrulybelieveicanbuildsomethingwiththistheyearoldisfullofgratitudeforhisfamilyissupportmyparentshavealwaysstoodbymepeopleinmycommunitymightnotknowwhatcannesisbuttheyknowiwenttofranceandthatalonemakesthemproudhewasinitiallynervousaboutnotspeakingenglishfluentlybutisoonrealisedthatlanguageisnotabarrierhesmiledatthescreeningpeoplefromfrancegermanyandjapancameuptomeandsaidyourstorymovedusthatisoneofthegreatestrewardsiwilleverreceivewhenhereturnshomealaminplanstobeginworkonafulllengthfeaturefilmitwillbeinourlanguageaboutourlandandourpeopleiwanttheboysandgirlsfromourvillagestoseethemselvesonscreenetoheartheirownstoriesatthecannesfilmfestivaltheshortfilmpalmedorwasawardedtoiamgladyouaredeadnowbytawfeekbarhomewhopersonallypraisedalaminisperformanceiwasoverwhelmedwhenhecameuptomeandsaidhelovedmyworkherecalledwhilesigningoffitfeltsurrealcaeabeaeaaeabeeabeaaeabeaeabeaeaceabeeaaeabfeafeaeabeaeaceabeeaaeaeafeaaeabfeabeabeeaaaeaaealaughingeaaeabeeaaceabfeaealaughingeaaeabfeaaeabeafeabeaeaaeabeeaaceabeeabeabfeaaeaeafeaaeeaaeaeabeaaeabeaaceabfeabeafeaeabeaaeealaughingeaaaeaeaealaughingeaaeabeaaceaeaaeabeeaa
"Bangladeshi superstar Shakib Khan has praised director Adnan Al Rajeev and his short film ""Ali"", after it earned a prestigious Special Mention at the 78th Cannes Film Festival, calling the achievement ""a historic moment for Bangladesh."" 

 His heartfelt post sparked a wave of excitement among fans and film insiders alike. Director Adnan Al Rajeev, visibly moved, replied in the comments: ""Thank you, Shakib Khan. We Love you.""
The recognition at Cannes marked a rare international honour for a Bangladeshi short film. Directed by Adnan Al Rajeev and co-produced by Tanveer Hossain and Kristine De Leon, ""Ali"" was one of 11 films selected globally for the Short Film Competition. It screened on May 22 and was awarded a Special Mention at the festival's closing ceremony. ""Ali"" tells the story of a teenage boy in a coastal town who dares to defy societal norms by entering a singing contest. Beneath this simple premise lies a layered tale of identity, longing, and escape.  সেনাসদর আরও জানিয়েছে, জাতীয় নিরাপত্তা বিঘ্নিত হয়, সেনাবাহিনী এমন কোনো বিষয়ে সম্পৃক্ত হবে না।",2025-05-25T10:48:02Z,bangladeshisuperstarshakibkhanhaspraiseddirectoradnanalrajeevandhisshortfilmaliafteritearnedaprestigiousspecialmentionatthethcannesfilmfestivalcallingtheachievementahistoricmomentforbangladeshhisheartfeltpostsparkedawaveofexcitementamongfansandfilminsidersalikedirectoradnanalrajeevvisiblymovedrepliedinthecommentsthankyoushakibkhanweloveyoutherecognitionatcannesmarkedarareinternationalhonourforabangladeshishortfilmdirectedbyadnanalrajeevandcoproducedbytanveerhossainandkristinedeleonaliwasoneoffilmsselectedgloballyfortheshortfilmcompetitionitscreenedonmayandwasawardedaspecialmentionatthefestivalisclosingceremonyalitellsthestoryofateenageboyinacoastaltownwhodarestodefysocietalnormsbyenteringasingingcontestbeneaththissimplepremiseliesalayeredtaleofidentitylongingandescapecaeabeaeaaeabeeabeaaeabeaeabeaeaceabeeaaeabfeafeaeabeaeaceabeeaaeaeafeaaeabfeabeabeeaaaeaaealaughingeaaeabeeaaceabfeaealaughingeaaeabfeaaeabeafeabeaeaaeabeeaaceabeeabeabfeaaeaeafeaaeeaaeaeabeaaeabeaaceabfeabeafeaeabeaaeealaughingeaaaeaeaealaughingeaaeabeaaceaeaaeabeeaa
"A popular narrative has emerged in recent years, suggesting that smartphones and social media are primarily responsible for declining teen mental health. Headlines warn of ""digital addiction"" and ""rewired brains,"" creating widespread anxiety among parents, educators, and policymakers. However, the scientific evidence paints a more nuanced picture, challenging many of these assumptions. ""For such a long time, we have heard how detrimental screen time is for our children,"" said Maisha Sarwar, a 33-year-old banker. ""My son is three and the way he devours Coco Melon frankly has me very worried."" Maisha is one of the many hundreds and thousands of parents who feel guilty about giving their children screen time, ridden with apprehensions about their social lives and mental health as a consequence of this quick fix. It may be time for some of that guilt to be put to rest, however. Despite extensive concerns, researchers have consistently failed to find convincing evidence that digital-technology use contributes to adolescent depression and other mental-health symptoms, despite decades of research on adolescents and their usage of technology. In fact, multiple studies and comprehensive reviews have indicated that social media is among the least influential factors when it comes to predicting adolescent mental health- similar, perhaps, to the effects of regularly eating potatoes and less impactful than wearing glasses or bicycling. Research consistently identifies a family history of mental disorders, offline factors such as sleep duration, early exposure to adversity (violence/discrimination), school-related and family-related stressors, economic insecurity, and access to mental health resources to have much stronger associations with adolescent mental health outcomes than technology use. ""My friends and I have had this conversation — strangely, we all feel that when we are sad or upset, we mostly turn to screen time to make us feel better,"" shares Samiha Manar, a 14-year-old student. ""We turn to Netflix, or Instagram for mindless distraction, or just pick up the phone and video call each other. I know there are a number of articles that will probably prove me wrong, but this is our reality."" Most studies on social media and mental health are correlational, meaning they are unable to determine whether social media causes mental health problems or vice versa. Interestingly, when Odgers examined the direction of this relationship, he mentioned, ""Recent research suggests that early mental-health symptoms may predict later social-media use, but not the other way around."" Another longitudinal study by Coyne, in 2020, followed adolescents over six years. He found no evidence that social media use predicted depression over time. Instead, they found some evidence for the reverse — that depression might predict subsequent social media use, explaining Samiha's feelings. When researchers connect with adolescents directly, they find young people using digital technologies for developmentally appropriate activities such as connecting with peers from their offline life, consuming music and media, playing games with friends, seeking health information, and finding supportive communities, especially for those with marginalised identities ""It's impossible to avoid it,"" says Jawad Shah, 17. ""From catching up on news to keeping in touch with peers, placing food orders to picking up new abilities, tech is ingrained into our lives."" Another teenager, Anfaas Karim, 18, talks about how he has never seen technology and screen time as anything but a friend. ""I was exposed to it ever since I was born,"" he says. ""It's done nothing but help me — with assignments, with establishing and maintaining connections with friends. ""It's taken me through COVID,"" he shrugs. He admits, however, that this ""friend"" might sometimes seem a little clingy, with its alluring distractions but over time, he's learned to strike a balance between his screen and real time. Dr Abdul Hamid, a psychoanalyst from Monobikash Foundation mentions, ""Technology, in itself, is not a villain. If anything, it has been quite the blessing, training our mind to work better, respond faster, and to generally keep up with whatever the machine can do for us."" The real problem, he feels is the complacency it has created in doing so. ""Imagine going on foot to deliver a letter and the physical effort it took to get the job done, only 20 or 30 odd years ago. Fast forward to now, when one ping on the social media is all it takes. It has cut down physical work by so much that people have become quite lethargic, forgetting to strike a reasonable balance between working the mind and body."" He finds this to be a disastrous consequence of technology, and one that gives rise to all sorts of psychological problems. ""People who are able to effectively strike that balance, go on to conquer space!"" According to the expert, the instant gratification that social media or games offer is also something one can get hooked to fairly quickly. ""Teens can get addicted to instantly gratifying technology so much that working for the real pleasures of life such as saving up for something or nurturing a passion begins to seem like a towering ask."" This too, Hamid says, is a major disadvantage of screens, in a world that is increasingly grateful to technology. ""Again, it's all about striking the right balance."" Rather than panic-mongering and restrictive approaches, existing evidence and expert advice suggest that parents understand both the benefits and risks of technology, based on its usage and individual circumstances. Focussing on digital literacy and teaching critical evaluation skills can be beneficial for teens rather than restrictive approaches. Parents should go through the content their children consume and observe how they use technology, promoting 'connected parenting.'

"She didn't arrive with a well-rehearsed pageant persona, or a wardrobe curated months in advance. In fact, Aklima Atika Konika's journey to the Miss World 2025 stage began in the kind of last-minute scramble most people wouldn't associate with one of the world's most prestigious beauty platforms. But maybe that's what makes her story worth listening to — not the polish, but the process. In this candid and wide-ranging conversation with Star Lifestyle, Aklima Atika Konika talks about resilience, responsibility, and what it really means to show up when the world is watching. Honestly, I'm still soaking it in. I had just a week to prepare, so everything felt rushed. But during the opening ceremony, when I held the Bangladesh flag and saw ""Bangladesh"" under my name — that's when it really hit me. I wasn't just Konika anymore; I was representing an entire nation. Authenticity. I've always stayed true to myself — a proud Bengali girl who feels confident in a saree. Even on a global stage, Bangladesh lives in my heart. This journey wouldn't have been possible without my support system: my national director, Azra Mahmood, from Azra Mahmood Talent Camp (AMTC), Dr Nilufar Islam from MBIT, and Efa Tabassum, Miss International Bangladesh 2024, who even shared her clothes with me. The outpouring of love from people online kept me going. It was chaotic! We got confirmation just days before the event, so I was arranging outfits and sponsors last minute. But despite the stress, we made it. I'm so grateful to Mehruz Munir of Zurhem for designing my finale and Top Model gowns. Fardin Bayejid, Bishwajit, and Trisha from Fashion Lab also supported me when others didn't. That kind of kindness is unforgettable. That I can still surprise myself. I pushed my limits without complaining and gave my all, even with limited time. That resilience is something I'm proud of. Mental health, especially for children. My initiative, ""Young Minds Matter,"" focuses on creating awareness, which I believe is the first step in healing. Too often, neurodivergent children are misunderstood, and I've seen first-hand how those early labels damage self-esteem. My goal is to make sure they don't grow up blaming themselves. I can't make grand promises because life changes us constantly. But right now, I genuinely want to continue this work. Even if I can't scale it immediately, I'll find a way to contribute. That's the promise I'm holding onto for myself. I've stopped planning since COVID-19! I once wanted to be a software engineer, never imagined myself in the media. But now, I've grown to love modelling. So yes, I'd like to explore it — but I'll also stay open to whatever life throws at me. I'm enjoying the surprises. First, ask yourself why you want it. Be clear and honest. Then start building the personality that reflects a Miss World winner — don't wait for the crown. Choose a cause that truly matters to you, and above all, be authentic. Miss World values realness. Be yourself, fully and unapologetically. I'm still learning and taking notes so I can help whoever comes next. Even if I don't win, I want to pass it forward.   Photo: Courtesy

"In the early hours of a stormy day, while returning from a flood-affected farming community, Sayed Zubaer Hasan received an unexpected nudge from a teammate: ""Check Google. Forbes just released the list."" Moments later, his name appeared on Forbes' 2025 '30 Under 30 Asia' under the Social Impact category. But instead of basking in the glow, he thought about the farmers they had just visited — struggling under rising waters, uncertain yields, and collapsing markets. For Hasan, this wasn't a personal victory. ""This is not just a company for us,"" he explained. ""Krishi Shwapno was always a movement — essentially meant to accelerate the dreams of farmers, not mine."" Born into a farmer's family, Hasan's earliest memories aren't of computers or classrooms — they're of soil, sweat, and unspoken frustration. ""My father didn't know how much fertiliser to use, how to test the soil, or when to sell,"" he recalled. ""He would work four to six months, then sell his crops at whatever price the middleman offered. There was no negotiation — just survival."" That helplessness shaped Krishi Shwapno. Founded in 2019, the startup offers a 360-degree solution for smallholder farmers, from pre-harvest planning to post-harvest market linkage. In a country where over 80 per cent of farmers are smallholders, flashy technology means little without contextual grounding. Hasan knew this from the start. ""We didn't throw apps at farmers and walk away,"" he explained. ""We started with soil-testing kits, because even that basic data was missing."" Krishi Shwapno's model is hyper-local. Through regional agents and field incubation, farmers receive training in financial literacy, sustainable practices, and climate-resilient methods. ""We give them digital learning content, hands-on sessions, and help them turn farming from mere survival to a form of enterprise."" But the real test was market access. ""Even after improving their methods, farmers were stuck,"" said Hasan. ""Without data-driven market forecasting or logistics support, they had no choice but to sell to local middlemen — often at a loss."" Krishi Shwapno's platform closes that loop, connecting farmers directly with buyers, processors, and urban retailers. As global eyes turn to food safety and climate-smart agriculture, Krishi Shwapno is quietly pushing Bangladesh in that direction. ""Clean agriculture isn't just about reducing pesticide use. It's about traceability, climate resilience, and dignity in production,"" said Hasan. Their training modules emphasise safe pesticide use, packaging hygiene, and crop selection tailored to climate-vulnerable regions. In char and coastal areas, where flash floods and soil salinity wreak havoc, Krishi Shwapno equips farmers with the tools and knowledge to adapt and survive. ""Farming in these areas shouldn't be a death sentence,"" he remarked. ""It should be a badge of resilience."" Hasan doesn't talk like your typical CEO. There are no growth charts or jargon-loaded pitches. Instead, he speaks in the language of empathy, responsibility, and pivoting. ""Social entrepreneurship only works if it comes from a place of pain,"" he explained. ""Ours did. That's why it works."" But he doesn't romanticise it either. ""This is not a glory trip. You need a problem-solving mindset, yes — but more than that, you need to execute. And when your first idea doesn't work, you pivot."" Krishi Shwapno started as a tech tool. Today, it's a service ecosystem. That transformation, he insists, is not a side note — it's the story. With 27,000 active smallholder farmers in their network and operations in 15 regions, Krishi Shwapno is expanding, but not by chasing scale for scale's sake. ""We want to build depth before we build width,"" he said. Their long-term vision? To ensure 50 per cent of Bangladesh's farmers adopt clean, climate-resilient practices within the next three years. That's ambitious — but then again, so is turning generational pain into generational change. When asked what advice he'd give to other young entrepreneurs, Hasan paused. ""Don't start a startup to escape a job. Start it because you see something broken and can't sleep until it's fixed."" He emphasised three traits every impact-driven entrepreneur must nurture: the ability to feel (empathy), the discipline to act (execution), and the courage to adapt (pivoting). ""Vision without execution is just daydreaming,"" he said. As we wrapped the interview, he remarked, ""Recognition is nice, but the real work begins the next day."" And perhaps that's the real measure of impact — not who makes the list, but who keeps showing up when the monsoon hits.   Photo: Courtesy

"It is more than just a place where food is prepared; A kitchen is the heart of any home and should undoubtedly meet your lifestyle and reflect your taste. A custom kitchen space allows for a dynamic approach. From countertops to cabinet hardware, everything can be made to reflect your style, irrespective of whether you like daring colours and warm wood tones, or chilly stone surfaces and minimal designs. The result: a place that looks and feels like you. Custom cabinets are where design meets functionality, maximising every inch of space. You can have pull-out racks for spices, deep drawers for storage, and secret compartments for keeping things out of sight. In addition, you can select the cabinet interiors that suit your cooking style. From integrated dividers to vertical tray storage, there is a custom solution for everything. A well-planned kitchen layout considers your activities, whether you usually throw dinner parties or enjoy meal prep in peace. Custom layouts can use the space, cutting down on all those unnecessary steps and maximising flow so that doing kitchen chores is easier. Choose the layout process of placing appliances from the most to the least used. Nothing will interrupt the flow of your kitchen with built-in ovens and panel-ready dishwashers alongside fridges that match up to your cabinetry. Just a smooth, classy place where every detail seems intentional in your design choices. Custom kitchen lighting design lets you layer light sources for function and ambience. Overhead pendant lights serve as a statement while under-cabinet lights brighten prep zones without hampering the mood. In fact, with dimmers and layered light fixtures, your kitchen becomes a space that adapts happily to your mood or schedule, bringing style and comfort. You can also choose lights that have auto-sensors so that they brighten and dim with the time of the day. Pull-out pantries, equipment spaces, and deep drawers bring immense efficiency in a customised kitchen. Here, you can give things an assigned spot while ensuring they look good. Not only that, custom elements such as fine cabinetry and built-in appliances make your everyday life easier. So, you are not designing the kitchen just for the now. You are building your future lifestyle that gains praise from friends and family. A customisable kitchen is beyond trend. It provides you with a space that meets your needs in life. When it has the right cabinetry, lighting, layout, and storage, your kitchen can easily turn into your favourite place in the house. সেনাসদর আরও জানিয়েছে, জাতীয় নিরাপত্তা বিঘ্নিত হয়, সেনাবাহিনী এমন কোনো বিষয়ে সম্পৃক্ত হবে না।",2025-05-25T09:39:02Z,itismorethanjustaplacewherefoodispreparehorrorakitchenistheheartofanyhomeandshouldundoubtedlymeetyourlifestyleandreflectyourtasteacustomkitchenspaceallowsforadynamicapproachfromcountertopstocabinethardwareeverythingcanbemadetoreflectyourstyleirrespectiveofwhetheryoulikedaringcoloursandwarmwoodtonesorchillystonesurfacesandminimaldesignstheresultaplacethatlooksandfeelslikeyoucustomcabinetsarewheredesignmeetsfunctionalitymaximisingeveryinchofspaceyoucanhavepulloutracksforspicesdeepdrawersforstorageandsecretcompartmentsforkeepingthingsoutofsightinadditionyoucanselectthecabinetinteriorsthatsuityourcookingstylefromintegrateddividerstoverticaltraystoragethereisacustomsolutionforeverythingawellplannedkitchenlayoutconsidersyouractivitieswhetheryouusuallythrowdinnerpartiesorenjoymealprepinpeacecustomlayoutscanusethespacecuttingdownonallthoseunnecessarystepsandmaximisingflowsothatdoingkitchenchoresiseasierchoosethelayoutprocessofplacingappliancesfromthemosttotheleastusednothingwillinterrupttheflowofyourkitchenwithbuiltinovensandpanelreadydishwashersalongsidefridgesthatmatchuptoyourcabinetryjustasmoothclassyplacewhereeverydetailseemsintentionalinyourdesignchoicescustomkitchenlightingdesignletsyoulayerlightsourcesforfunctionandambienceoverheadpendantlightsserveasastatementwhileundercabinetlightsbrightenprepzoneswithouthamperingthemoodinfactwithdimmersandlayeredlightfixturesyourkitchenbecomesaspacethatadaptshappilytoyourmoodorschedulebringingstyleandcomfortyoucanalsochooselightsthathaveautosensorssothattheybrightenanddimwiththetimeofthedaypulloutpantriesequipmentspacesanddeepdrawersbringimmenseefficiencyinacustomisedkitchenhereyoucangivethingsanassignedspotwhileensuringtheylookgoodnotonlythatcustomelementssuchasfinecabinetryandbuiltinappliancesmakeyoureverydaylifeeasiersoyouarenotdesigningthekitchenjustforthenowyouarebuildingyourfuturelifestylethatgainspraisefromfriendsandfamilyacustomisablekitchenisbeyondtrenditprovidesyouwithaspacethatmeetsyourneedsinlifewhenithastherightcabinetrylightinglayoutandstorageyourkitchencaneasilyturnintoyourfavouriteplaceinthehouseeabeaeaaeabeeabeaaeabeaeabeaeaceabeeaaeabfeafeaeabeaeaceabeeaaeaeafeaaeabfeabeabeeaaaeaaealaughingeaaeabeeaaceabfeaealaughingeaaeabfeaaeabeafeabeaeaaeabeeaaceabeeabeabfeaaeaeafeaaeeaaeaeabeaaeabeaaceabfeabeafeaeabeaaeealaughingeaaaeaeaealaughingeaaeabeaaceaeaaeabeeaa
"In Bangladesh, jewellery has always been more than just something to put on. It bears memory, uplifts tradition, and showcases identity. From royal jhumkas to simple churis, timeless designs are passed down from one generation to another, each filled with a cultural legacy. However, fast fashion and ornaments coming out of the massive factories began flooding the shops, turning many of the heritage styles out of everyday wear. To young consumers, traditional jewellery seemed to feel old. That perception is changing today. Small-scale designers and vendors are increasingly releasing a new generation of Bangladeshi jewellery that views the craft through a modern lens, combining traditional skills with modern tastes and top-level customisation. What characterises this new wave is customisation. Clients today are interested more in meaningful pieces that embody their individual identity with a subtle hint towards the roots they grew up with, over straight-up commercial imitation. ""Clients don't just want jewellery. They want stories,"" said Dhaka-based designer, Zerin Tasnim Khan, founder of 6 Yards Story. ""They're drawn to ornaments that connect them to heritage but also fit their style, their weddings, their identity."" This is where small entrepreneurs are found at the forefront. These enterprises flourish in offering handcrafted pieces, often a cooperatively made effort with the client. Many young designers like Zerin have also studied design or architecture, and use that creative base to modernise old motifs. She started her business online in 2014, first selling taat sarees inspired by her roots in Sirajganj. But, soon her handmade, custom glamorised jewellery stole the attention of people. ""I was shocked at the response,"" she remarked. ""People began to appreciate the jewellery I was designing. At that time, I knew I had to switch my focus."" As demand grew, she was able to open a studio this year where customers can come, touch, and try the items before they buy. The studio is now a favourite among brides and lifestyle clients. This suggests the wider change going on in the country's fashion landscape. From kundan sets to chandbalis, people have embraced the traditional art, but given it an entirely fresh take, one that feels wearable and speaks deeply to their identity. Customisation is beyond aesthetics, though. It also builds a bond. The clients contribute to the design process by specifying materials, shapes, or even engraving initials or symbols that carry meaning for them. That revival is in reaction to changing lifestyle values. With everything going fast, there is a growing appreciation for slow-made, meaningful creations. Nevertheless, the path is not devoid of obstacles. As Zerin recalled, ""I used to deliver products myself when online delivery was not feasible. Yet, I find people losing patience so easily with their creative ventures. How will you ever stand out in a sea of hard workers if you give up?"" This combination of grit and reinvention is propelling the new-generation of jewellery industry in Bangladesh. Needless to say, in the hands of this generation of artisans, tradition is now being refashioned, revived, and proudly worn into this new millennium.   Photo: Courtesy

"The mind is barren at times like nature in harsh summer days. Creativity seems to dry up and like birds in thirst longing for water from the heavens, I desperately search for ideas, look for inspiration, sometimes, even a divine intervention. And then, suddenly a storm begins to gather and ideas start to flow. Like the Baishakhi wind, my mind expands its inner depths, and suddenly, there is beauty in whatever I create and, in that moment, I get a taste of ecstasy. On days touched by creative madness, everything falls into place. A single line written, a picture drawn, and music hummed. I sense the rhythm in life. But, on days of creative slumber, nothing seems to work. I sit there, staring at the page, the screen, waiting for that very moment when the creative juices, I pray, will begin to flow. Nothing! Not a word. I look back and remember what it used to feel like. How ideas would just pour in, how my hands could not keep up writing with the racing thoughts in my mind.  I try to force it and recreate those moments. The more I try, the more distant it feels. And then, I start questioning everything. Was I ever really creative or was this utter luck, every single time? The moments of creation are neither obedient nor predictable. When they do come, they teach me to listen more deeply, not just to the world around me but to myself. They remind me that beneath the layers of routine and responsibility, there is wonder. And, creation is often born from this beautiful contradiction. From the tension between what is and what could be. I have also come to realise that while the act is often born out of calm, it is mostly out of chaos. I have felt it in the depths of solitude. In the dead end of the night when the world sleeps, yet, the mind moves violently with thoughts. Creation becomes a moment of quiet rebellion against the silence within. And there is something beautiful about those inner turmoil. Because you see, there is a wildness at the heart of creation. A kind of holy disorder. And within that disorder lies clarity. It tells me: you are more than your limits. You are capable of birth not just biological, but emotional, spiritual, and artistic. You can bring into the world something that did not exist before. Creation has always had a sacred connection with the feminine. Not only in its power to birth but in its depth to feel. To nurture contradiction. In those spells of creative spur, we often find ourselves speaking to that quiet, revered space of femininity, whether in others or within ourselves. What surprises most me is how the body reacts to all this. Understandably, the mind would reject stillness and rebel, but I taste the ecstasy of creation in my pulse, as it quickens; my hands, as they feel restless; and my senses, as I feel they have sharpened. It's as if every part of me is drawn into this act of becoming. I don't always understand where it comes from but I know, instinctively, that it must be respected. Back in the day, I tried to control these feelings. Tried to tame the moments when creativity flowed like a wild horse. But as I have grown older, I believe I have grown wiser too. Over time, I've stopped trying to control these moments, for creation does not care for control. It invites us to gallop wildly into ourselves and find something, ANYTHING, that's real. And now, I've learned to wait for them and to trust those instincts.   Creation, ultimately, is a conversation — with time, with nature, with grief, with beauty, with God. And in that conversation, we become human. We become more ourselves. Perhaps, that is true ecstasy. Not in the finished work but in the moment of its becoming. In that suspended breath, when everything you are flows into something beyond you. It is fleeting. It does not stay. But it leaves a trace. A warmth. A memory. A truth. Based on the poem, Srishti Shukher Ullashey (In the ecstasy of creation) by Kazi Nazrul Islam.

"For decades, Bangladesh's banknotes have offered a curated narrative of the nation, featuring founding fathers, liberation war imagery, and cultural monuments. But the soon-to-be-released Tk 5 note, arriving after Eid-ul-Adha, as per the reports, adds a new chapter to that narrative. This time, the note will carry the likenesses of Abu Sayeed and Mugdha, two faces synonymous with the youth-led protests that rocked the nation in 2024. It's a bold shift, not just in aesthetics, but in what we, as a country, choose to memorialise in ink and currency. To some, it's an overdue recognition of civic courage. To others, it raises a pressing question: how much of contemporary history should we print on money? ""I think it's a thoughtful and powerful way to honour young people who sacrificed their lives to challenge an increasingly authoritarian system,"" says Nishat Zaman, a writer and public university lecturer. ""I appreciate the intent, but I also hope we don't overdo it. These faces matter, but so do the martyrs of 1952 and 1971. Commemoration should be balanced, not reactive."" That friction between remembering the present and revering the past is exactly what makes this new Tk 5 note more than just legal tender. It's a piece of living memory. And like all memory, it's messy, contested, and deeply political. Abu Sayeed did not head a political party, but he died during protests, allegedly due to police action, while demanding reforms to a government hiring system that many believed unfairly favoured certain groups. Similarly, Mugdha was one of the youngest participants in the protests, and he became a symbol not just of courage, but of generational frustration. By placing their likenesses — stylised and not full portraits, as per Bangladesh Bank's statement — on the Tk 5 note, the state is doing something radical. It is institutionalising dissent. It is acknowledging, however cautiously, that civic action from young people matters. ""It's surreal,"" remarked Samira Rahman, a final-year political science student at Dhaka University. ""It's the first time someone who didn't win a war, hold a government office, or die fifty years ago is being printed on our money. And they look like us."" The politics of currency are not new. Every nation curate its memory through the faces and symbols it puts on their currency. In Bangladesh, that memory has been mostly selective, either celebratory or sacred. Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the Language Movement martyrs, the Shaheed Minar — all emotionally resonant, but chronologically far-removed. The new design breaks that pattern. It brings in contemporaneity. That's a risk. Not everyone is happy. ""Currency should be timeless,"" argues Azharul Islam, currently working at a private bank based in Dhaka. ""Introducing figures tied to ongoing debates or unresolved narratives risks making money feel unstable — too reactive."" But others argue that money has always been reactive. ""Why must we wait 40 years to decide someone mattered?"" counters Rahman. ""In a digital age, memory travels faster than monuments. Our currency should reflect that."" One cannot ignore the timing. The decision to redesign the note comes amid a broader wave of unrest, student activism, and growing scepticism toward institutional credibility. In that light, this new Tk 5 note could be read as a state concession. A way of softening the edges of unresolved grievances. Or perhaps, a strategic embrace — an attempt to redirect youthful energy from the streets to state-sanctioned memory. And yet — despite all its symbolism — it's still just money. It will be crumpled, exchanged, forgotten in pockets, and lost in laundry cycles. Perhaps that's what makes it powerful. You can't lock it up in a glass museum. It circulates and confronts. It is worth mentioning that, according to the official statement from Bangladesh Bank, the new Tk 5 note is part of a broader redesign of Bangladesh's currency. The Tk 10 note will depict youth unity and the Baitul Mukarram National Mosque. The Tk 100 will highlight the Sundarbans' spotted deer and tiger, and the Tk 200 will showcase religious diversity with a mosque, temple, church, and pagoda, while the Tk 500 will feature the historic Ahsan Manzil. সেনাসদর আরও জানিয়েছে, জাতীয় নিরাপত্তা বিঘ্নিত হয়, সেনাবাহিনী এমন কোনো বিষয়ে সম্পৃক্ত হবে না।",2025-05-22T10:24:01Z,fordecadesbangladeshisbanknoteshaveofferedacuratednarrativeofthenationfeaturingfoundingfathersliberationwarimageryandculturalmonumentsbutthesoontobereleasedtknotearrivingaftereiduladhaasperthereportsaddsanewchaptertothatnarrativethistimethenotewillcarrythelikenessesofabusayeedandmugdhatwofacessynonymouswiththeyouthledproteststhatrockedthenationinitisaboldshiftnotjustinaestheticsbutinwhatweasacountrychoosetomemorialiseininkandcurrencytosomeitisanoverduerecognitionofciviccouragetoothersitraisesapressingquestionhowmuchofcontemporaryhistoryshouldweprintonmoneyithinkitisathoughtfulandpowerfulwaytohonouryoungpeoplewhosacrificedtheirlivestochallengeanincreasinglyauthoritariansystemsaysnishatzamanawriterandpublicuniversitylectureriappreciatetheintentbutialsohopewedonotoverdoitthesefacesmatterbutsodothemartyrsofandcommemorationshouldbebalancednotreactivethatfrictionbetweenrememberingthepresentandreveringthepastisexactlywhatmakesthisnewtknotemorethanjustlegaltenderitisapieceoflivingmemoryandlikeallmemoryitismessycontestedanddeeplypoliticalabusayeeddidnotheadapoliticalpartybuthediedduringprotestsallegedlyduetopoliceactionwhiledemandingreformstoagovernmenthiringsystemthatmanybelievedunfairlyfavouredcertaingroupssimilarlymugdhawasoneoftheyoungestparticipantsintheprotestsandhebecameasymbolnotjustofcouragebutofgenerationalfrustrationbyplacingtheirlikenessesestylisedandnotfullportraitsasperbangladeshbankisstatementeonthetknotethestateisdoingsomethingradicalitisinstitutionalisingdissentitisacknowledginghowevercautiouslythatcivicactionfromyoungpeoplemattersitissurrealremarkedsamirarahmanafinalyearpoliticalsciencestudentatdhakauniversityitisthefirsttimesomeonewhodidnotwinawarholdagovernmentofficeordiefiftyyearsagoisbeingprintedonourmoneyandtheylooklikeusthepoliticsofcurrencyarenotneweverynationcurateitsmemorythroughthefacesandsymbolsitputsontheircurrencyinbangladeshthatmemoryhasbeenmostlyselectiveeithercelebratoryorsacredsheikhmujiburrahmanthelanguagemovementmartyrstheshaheedminareallemotionallyresonantbutchronologicallyfarremovedthenewdesignbreaksthatpatternitbringsincontemporaneitythatisarisknoteveryoneishappycurrencyshouldbetimelessarguesazharulislamcurrentlyworkingataprivatebankbasedindhakaintroducingfigurestiedtoongoingdebatesorunresolvednarrativesrisksmakingmoneyfeelunstableetooreactivebutothersarguethatmoneyhasalwaysbeenreactivewhymustwewaityearstodecidesomeonematteredcountersrahmaninadigitalagememorytravelsfasterthanmonumentsourcurrencyshouldreflectthatonecannotignorethetimingthedecisiontoredesignthenotecomesamidabroaderwaveofunreststudentactivismandgrowingscepticismtowardinstitutionalcredibilityinthatlightthisnewtknotecouldbereadasastateconcessionawayofsofteningtheedgesofunresolvedgrievancesorperhapsastrategicembraceeanattempttoredirectyouthfulenergyfromthestreetstostatesanctionedmemoryandyetedespiteallitssymbolismeitisstilljustmoneyitwillbecrumpledexchangedforgotteninpocketsandlostinlaundrycyclesperhapsthatiswhatmakesitpowerfulyoucannotlockitupinaglassmuseumitcirculatesandconfrontsitisworthmentioningthataccordingtotheofficialstatementfrombangladeshbankthenewtknoteispartofabroaderredesignofbangladeshiscurrencythetknotewilldepictyouthunityandthebaitulmukarramnationalmosquethetkwillhighlightthesundarbansspotteddeerandtigerandthetkwillshowcasereligiousdiversitywithamosquetemplechurchandpagodawhilethetkwillfeaturethehistoricahsanmanzileabeaeaaeabeeabeaaeabeaeabeaeaceabeeaaeabfeafeaeabeaeaceabeeaaeaeafeaaeabfeabeabeeaaaeaaealaughingeaaeabeeaaceabfeaealaughingeaaeabfeaaeabeafeabeaeaaeabeeaaceabeeabeabfeaaeaeafeaaeeaaeaeabeaaeabeaaceabfeabeafeaeabeaaeealaughingeaaaeaeaealaughingeaaeabeaaceaeaaeabeeaa
"After a commendable performance against India at the AFC Asian Cup Qualifier in March this year, the Bangladesh men's national football team is set to face Singapore in the third round of the AFC Asian Cup Qualifiers at the National Stadium in Dhaka on June 10. The excitement amongst fans surrounding this match is palpable. Despite it being a qualifying match, it has the potential to create a spark that can change the course of Bangladesh's footballing history. Bangladesh football had been going through a slump for quite a while. Currently ranked 183rd in the world, the team was ranked below 190 just a couple of years ago. While the team tried its best under the captaincy of Jamal Bhuyan, poor results and management of the Bangladesh Football Federation (BFF) would leave fans with little to be excited about. Nevertheless, that all started to change when rumours surfaced of Leicester City midfielder Hamza Choudhury (currently on loan at Sheffield United) switching his international allegiance to Bangladesh. On top of that, the previous BFF administration, largely disliked by the fans, was replaced by a new one, led by current BFF president Tabith Awal. Soon after that, Hamza's arrival was confirmed as well. With a new administration in place and a player with Premier League experience representing the country, fans started to hope, and their enthusiasm was noticeable online. Football fans started to talk about the national team more often, Facebook groups discussing the national team began popping up, and the once largely ignored BFF Facebook page was now enjoying regular interactions from the fans. Amidst this growing enthusiasm, the team had an amazing opportunity during Hamza's debut match for Bangladesh against India to give the fans a victory. The match ended in a 0-0 draw, but going toe-to-toe with a much higher-ranked India on their own turf gave the fans a reason to expect big things from Bangladesh in the next few matches. This is where the match against Singapore comes in. Not only is this a must-win game for Bangladesh in order to solidify their chances to qualify for the Asian Cup, it is expected to be Hamza's first competitive match at home. The match is also expected to see the highly anticipated competitive debut of Bangladeshi-origin Canadian Premier League midfielder Shamit Shome if everything goes according to plan. BFF also has plans to set up trials for more Bangladeshi-origin players from abroad in the near future. The match against Singapore will also be an opportunity for fans to witness their team in a competitive match live for the first time in the newly renovated National Stadium, which was under renovation and thus closed to the public since September 2021. It's as if the stage could not have been set any more perfectly for the newly rejuvenated Bangladesh football team to show what they can do. Coincidentally, all this is happening at a time when the popularity of the Bangladesh Men's National Cricket Team, the most followed sports team in the country, is in decline due to its string of poor performances, with the latest disappointment coming in the form of a series loss against the United Arab Emirates (UAE). With the cricket team in shambles, the football team has the opportunity to capitalise and shift the national attention to football by securing an inspiring victory. While the objective of this match is to secure points for qualification for the AFC Asian Cup, the significance of this match goes beyond that. A win will not only help us to qualify but also potentially initiate a new beginning in Bangladesh football and revitalise the country's football culture by both retaining current fans and welcoming new ones. With so much to look forward to, Bangladeshi football fans are counting the days left to face Singapore. An opportunity like this has not come in a long time and it's up to the team to make the most of it.

"A US judge on Friday blocked the Trump administration from revoking Harvard University's ability to enroll foreign students, a move that ratcheted up White House efforts to conform practices in academia to President Donald Trump's policies. U.S. District Judge Allison Burroughs' order provides temporary relief to the thousands of international students who were faced with being forced to transfer under a policy that the Ivy League school called part of the administration's broader effort to retaliate against it for refusing to ""surrender its academic independence."" The Trump administration may appeal Burroughs' ruling. Spokespeople for the Justice Department and the Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to requests for comment. In a lawsuit filed in Boston federal court earlier on Friday, Harvard called the revocation a ""blatant violation"" of the U.S. Constitution and other federal laws, and had an ""immediate and devastating effect"" on the university and more than 7,000 visa holders. ""Without its international students, Harvard is not Harvard,"" the 389-year-old school said in the lawsuit filed in Boston federal court. Harvard enrolled nearly 6,800 international students in its current school year, equal to 27% of total enrollment. The termination of Harvard's Student and Exchange Visitor Program certification, effective with the 2025-2026 academic year, was announced on Thursday by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem. In her brief order blocking the policy for two weeks, Burroughs said Harvard had shown it could be harmed before there was an opportunity to hear the case in full. The judge, an appointee of Democratic President Barack Obama, scheduled hearings for May 27 and May 29 to consider next steps in the case. Trump's pressure on Harvard is part of the Republican's broader campaign to compel universities, law firms, news media, courts and other institutions that value independence from partisan politics to align with his agenda. The campaign has included efforts to deport foreign students who participated in pro-Palestinian protests but committed no crimes, retaliate against law firms that employ lawyers who have challenged Trump, and a suggestion by Trump to impeach a judge for an immigration ruling the president didn't like. Harvard, based in Cambridge, Massachusetts, has pushed back hard against Trump, having previously sued to restore some $3 billion in federal grants that had been frozen or canceled. Some institutions have made concessions to Trump. Columbia University agreed to reform disciplinary processes and review curricula for courses on the Middle East, after Trump pulled $400 million in funding over allegations the Ivy League school had not done enough to combat antisemitism. In a statement before Burroughs' ruling, White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson dismissed the lawsuit. ""If only Harvard cared this much about ending the scourge of anti-American, anti-Semitic, pro-terrorist agitators on their campus they wouldn't be in this situation to begin with,"" Jackson said. ""Harvard should spend their time and resources on creating a safe campus environment instead of filing frivolous lawsuits,"" she added. সেনাসদর আরও জানিয়েছে, জাতীয় নিরাপত্তা বিঘ্নিত হয়, সেনাবাহিনী এমন কোনো বিষয়ে সম্পৃক্ত হবে না।",2025-05-23T16:40:23Z,ausjudgeonfridayblockedthetrumpadministrationfromrevokingharvarduniversityisabilitytoenrollforeignstudentsamovethatratchetedupwhitehouseeffortstoconformpracticesinacademiatocapresidentdonaldtrumpiscapoliciesusdistrictjudgeallisonburroughsorderprovidestemporaryrelieftothethousandsofinternationalstudentswhowerefacedwithbeingforcedtotransferunderapolicythattheivyleagueschoolcalledpartoftheadministrationisbroaderefforttoretaliateagainstitforrefusingtosurrenderitsacademicindependencethetrumpadministrationmayappealburroughsrulingspokespeopleforthejusticedepartmentandthedepartmentofhomelandsecuritydidnotimmediatelyrespondtorequestsforcommentinalawsuitfiledinbostonfederalcourtearlieronfridayharvardcalledtherevocationablatantviolationoftheusconstitutionandotherfederallawsandhadanimmediateanddevastatingeffectontheuniversityandmorethanvisaholderswithoutitscainternationalstudentsharvardisnotharvardtheyearoldschoolsaidinthelawsuitfiledinbostonfederalcourtharvardenrollednearlyinternationalstudentsinitscurrentschoolyearequaltooftotalenrollmentthecaterminationcaofharvardisstudentandexchangevisitorprogramcertificationeffectivewiththeacademicyearwasannouncedonthursdaybyhomelandsecuritysecretarykristinoeminherbrieforderblockingthepolicyfortwoweeksburroughssaidharvardhadshownitcouldbeharmedbeforetherewasanopportunitytohearthecaseinfullthejudgeanappointeeofdemocraticpresidentbarackobamascheduledhearingsformayandmaytoconsidernextstepsinthecasetrumpispressureonharvardispartoftherepublicanisbroadercampaigntocompeluniversitieslawfirmsnewsmediacourtsandotherinstitutionsthatvalueindependencefrompartisanpoliticstoalignwithhisagendathecampaignhasincludedeffortstodeportforeignstudentswhoparticipatedinpropalestinianprotestsbutcommittednocrimesretaliateagainstlawfirmsthatemploylawyerswhohavechallengedtrumpandasuggestionbytrumptoimpeachajudgeforanimmigrationrulingthepresidentdidnotlikeharvardbasedincambridgemassachusettshaspushedbackhardagainsttrumphavingpreviouslysuedtorestoresomebillioninfederalgrantsthathadbeenfrozenorcanceledsomeinstitutionshavemadeconcessionstotrumpcolumbiauniversityagreedtoreformdisciplinaryprocessesandreviewcurriculaforcoursesonthemiddleeastaftertrumppulledmillioninfundingoverallegationstheivyleagueschoolhadnotdoneenoughtocombatantisemitisminastatementbeforeburroughsrulingwhitehousespokespersonabigailjacksondismissedthelawsuitifonlyharvardcaredthismuchaboutendingthescourgeofantiamericanantisemiticproterroristagitatorsontheircampustheywouldnotbeinthissituationtobeginwithjacksonsaidharvardshouldspendtheirtimeandresourcesoncreatingasafecampusenvironmentinsteadoffilingfrivolouslawsuitssheaddedeabeaeaaeabeeabeaaeabeaeabeaeaceabeeaaeabfeafeaeabeaeaceabeeaaeaeafeaaeabfeabeabeeaaaeaaealaughingeaaeabeeaaceabfeaealaughingeaaeabfeaaeabeafeabeaeaaeabeeaaceabeeabeabfeaaeaeafeaaeeaaeaeabeaaeabeaaceabfeabeafeaeabeaaeealaughingeaaaeaeaealaughingeaaeabeaaceaeaaeabeeaa
"Amongst the Bangladeshi students aspiring to pursue higher education abroad, the United Kingdom is a popular destination for various reasons. However, with the UK immigration policies coming under further scrutiny, it's important to be aware of the recent developments surrounding the student visa and how it can potentially affect you before you set out to the UK for your studies. Due to criticism about the rising number of immigrants, the UK government had already introduced multiple changes to its student visa policy, including a dependent ban on students coming to study postgraduate taught courses, as part of its immigration policy changes in 2024. The effects of those changes were seen immediately. The UK saw a 14 percent decrease in the number of sponsored student visas in 2024 compared to the previous year. The biggest declines were seen in students coming from countries like Nigeria, Bangladesh and India. This drop in international students has also contributed to a decline in net immigration to the UK by around 20 percent. Now, the newly elected Labour government seems to be looking to double down on efforts to reduce net immigration, with Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer introducing his Immigration White Paper. White papers are documents introduced by the UK government that set out their proposals for future legislation. According to him, the immigration White Paper includes a ""comprehensive plan"" to tackle high net immigration. While the Immigration White Paper covers various sectors of immigration, special attention was given to student visa policies, and changes are proposed with the intention to reduce international students. The reasoning given for this was that a large number of overseas students moved from university into low-paid work and applied to move from a study visa into the asylum system. A large number of these asylum applications reportedly appeared to be fraud. However, international students are still important to the UK due to their contribution to the economy. Thus, the drastic changes that were rumoured to be proposed before the white paper was published were not brought forward. Regardless, some proposals were still made that will make it harder for students to choose the UK as their study abroad destination if implemented. The first notable proposal is the reduction in the length of the graduate visa or post-study work permit, which has been proposed to be reduced to 18 months from two years. This will be less than the current length of post-study work permit in Australia and Canada, which are two years and three years, respectively. The Graduate Visa is a key factor for many students in choosing the UK, including Md Tanzim Islam, a BBA graduate from University of Liberal Arts Bangladesh (ULAB) who is currently planning to apply to study MSc in Business Analytics in the UK soon. ""I plan to apply for a full-time job in the UK after graduation but I am worried that it will become harder for me to secure a job within limited time, if the proposals in the white paper are implemented such as reduction of length of the post-study work permit,"" Tanzim says. The white paper also mentioned considering 'introducing a levy on higher education provider income from international students, to be reinvested into the higher education and skills system'. This can lead to an increase in tuition fees at universities throughout the UK for international students. In addition to that, proposals also stated that sponsoring institutions will face tougher requirements in order to recruit international students and will be subject to a Basic Compliance Assessment (BCA), which will be an annual assessment used to monitor each sponsor's level of compliance. Sponsors that fail may have their sponsorship licence revoked and temporarily be removed from the Register of Student Sponsors for up to two years. In addition to the above-mentioned changes, other changes are also proposed that may affect a student's plans after graduation, such as the standard qualifying period for settlement in the UK has been proposed to be increased to ten years from five. This is a matter of concern for many students who have already moved to the UK. One of them is Mohammad Fardin Rohid, who is currently pursuing an Msc International Banking and Finance degree at London Metropolitan University. ""It's frustrating for international students who have already spent a lot of tuition fees and moved with the current rules in mind. My plan was to work in the finance sector but I am now reconsidering as I feel like working 10 years to qualify for settlement can be frustrating. I am considering to pursue a PhD or moving to another country, maybe somewhere in Europe or Australia,"" Mohammad says. While there is a lot of discussion going on around these proposals, it is important to remember that these changes are not yet law. Thus, none of the changes mentioned has been implemented yet, and it is yet to be decided whether these changes will come into effect if they do. Regardless, any student planning to go to the UK in the near future should keep an eye on the reforms and see if they can affect them, as the UK government's drive for reducing net immigration is very real.

"US President Donald Trump's administration revoked Harvard University's ability to enroll international students on Thursday, and is forcing current foreign students to transfer to other schools or lose their legal status, while also threatening to expand the crackdown to other colleges. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem ordered the department to terminate Harvard University's Student and Exchange Visitor Program certification effective for the 2025-2026 school year, the department said in a statement. Noem accused the university of ""fostering violence, antisemitism, and coordinating with the Chinese Communist Party."" Harvard said the move by the Trump administration - which affects thousands of students - was illegal and amounted to retaliation. The decision marked a significant escalation of the Trump administration's campaign against the elite Ivy League university in Cambridge, Massachusetts, which has emerged as one of Trump's most prominent institutional targets. The move came after Harvard refused to provide information that Noem demanded about some foreign student visa holders at Harvard, the department said. Harvard enrolled nearly 6,800 international students in the 2024-2025 school year, amounting to 27% of its total enrollment, according to university statistics. In 2022, Chinese nationals were the biggest group of foreign students at 1,016, university figures showed. After that were students from Canada, India, South Korea, Britain, Germany, Australia, Singapore and Japan. The Chinese Embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment. ""It is a privilege, not a right, for universities to enroll foreign students and benefit from their higher tuition payments to help pad their multibillion-dollar endowments,"" Noem said in a statement. In a letter to the university, Noem gave Harvard ""the opportunity"" to regain its certification by turning over within 72 hours a raft of records about foreign students, including any video or audio of their protest activity in the past five years. Harvard called the government's action ""unlawful"" and said it was ""fully committed"" to educating foreign students. ""This retaliatory action threatens serious harm to the Harvard community and our country, and undermines Harvard's academic and research mission,"" the university said in a statement. Congressional Democrats denounced the revocation, with US Representative Jaime Raskin calling it an ""intolerable attack on Harvard's independence and academic freedom"" and saying it was government retaliation for Harvard's previous resistance to Trump. Trump has already frozen some $3 billion in federal grants to Harvard in recent weeks, leading the university to sue to restore the funding. In a separate lawsuit related to Trump's efforts to terminate the legal status of hundreds of foreign students across the US, a federal judge ruled on Thursday that the administration could not end their status without following proper regulatory procedures. It was not immediately clear how that ruling would affect the action against Harvard. During an interview with Fox News' ""The Story with Martha MacCallum,"" Noem was asked if she was considering similar moves at other universities, including Columbia University in New York. ""Absolutely, we are,"" Noem said. ""This should be a warning to every other university to get your act together."" TRUMP TARGETS UNIVERSITIES Trump, a Republican, took office in January pledging a wide-ranging immigration crackdown. His administration has tried to revoke student visas and green cards of foreign students who participated in pro-Palestinian protests. He has undertaken an extraordinary effort to revamp private colleges and schools across the US, claiming they foster anti-American, Marxist and ""radical left"" ideologies. He has criticized Harvard for hiring prominent Democrats for teaching or leadership positions. The US Department of Health and Human Services said on Monday that it was terminating a further $60 million in federal grants to Harvard because it failed to address antisemitic harassment and ethnic discrimination. In a legal complaint filed earlier this month, Harvard said it was committed to combating antisemitism and had taken steps to ensure its campus is safe and welcoming to Jewish and Israeli students. Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, a senior fellow with the American Immigration Council, a pro-immigration advocacy group, said the action against Harvard's student visa program ""needlessly punishes thousands of innocent students."" ""None of them have done anything wrong, they're just collateral damage to Trump,"" he said on the social media site Bluesky. সেনাসদর আরও জানিয়েছে, জাতীয় নিরাপত্তা বিঘ্নিত হয়, সেনাবাহিনী এমন কোনো বিষয়ে সম্পৃক্ত হবে না।",2025-05-22T18:32:51Z,uspresidentdonaldtrumpisadministrationrevokedharvarduniversityisabilitytoenrollinternationalstudentsonthursdayandisforcingcurrentforeignstudentstotransfertootherschoolsorlosetheirlegalstatuswhilealsothreateningtoetonguestickingoutandthecrackdowntoothercollegeshomelandsecuritysecretarykristinoemorderedthedepartmenttoterminateharvarduniversityisstudentandexchangevisitorprogramcertificationeffectivefortheschoolyearthedepartmentsaidinastatementnoemaccusedtheuniversityoffosteringviolenceantisemitismandcoordinatingwiththechinesecommunistpartyharvardsaidthemovebythetrumpadministrationwhichaffectsthousandsofstudentswasillegalandamountedtoretaliationthedecisionmarkedasignificantescalationofthetrumpadministrationiscampaignagainsttheeliteivyleagueuniversityincambridgemassachusettswhichhasemergedasoneoftrumpismostprominentinstitutionaltargetsthemovecameafterharvardrefusedtoprovideinformationthatnoemdemandedaboutsomeforeignstudentvisaholdersatharvardthedepartmentsaidharvardenrollednearlyinternationalstudentsintheschoolyearamountingtoofitstotalenrollmentaccordingtouniversitystatisticsinchinesenationalswerethebiggestgroupofforeignstudentsatuniversityfiguresshowedafterthatwerestudentsfromcanadaindiasouthkoreabritaingermanyaustraliasingaporeandjapanthechineseembassyinwashingtondidnotimmediatelyrespondtoarequestforcommentitisaprivilegenotarightforuniversitiestoenrollforeignstudentsandbenefitfromtheirhighertuitionpaymentstohelppadtheirmultibilliondollarendowmentsnoemsaidinastatementinalettertotheuniversitynoemgaveharvardtheopportunitytoregainitscertificationbyturningoverwithinhoursaraftofrecordsaboutforeignstudentsincludinganyvideooraudiooftheirprotestactivityinthepastfiveyearsharvardcalledthegovernmentisactionunlawfulandsaiditwasfullycommittedtoeducatingforeignstudentsthisretaliatoryactionthreatensseriousharmtotheharvardcommunityandourcountryandunderminesharvardisacademicandresearchmissiontheuniversitysaidinastatementcongressionaldemocratsdenouncedtherevocationwithusrepresentativejaimeraskincallingitanintolerableattackonharvardisindependenceandacademicfreedomandsayingitwasgovernmentretaliationforharvardispreviousresistancetotrumptrumphasalreadyfrozensomebillioninfederalgrantstoharvardinrecentweeksleadingtheuniversitytosuetorestorethefundinginaseparatelawsuitrelatedtotrumpiseffortstoterminatethelegalstatusofhundredsofforeignstudentsacrosstheusafederaljudgeruledonthursdaythattheadministrationcouldnotendtheirstatuswithoutfollowingproperregulatoryproceduresitwasnotimmediatelyclearhowthatrulingwouldaffecttheactionagainstharvardduringaninterviewwithfoxnewsthestorywithmarthamaccallumnoemwasaskedifshewasconsideringsimilarmovesatotheruniversitiesincludingcolumbiauniversityinnewyorkabsolutelywearenoemsaidthisshouldbeawarningtoeveryotheruniversitytogetyouracttogethertrumptargetsuniversitiestrumparepublicantookofficeinjanuarypledgingawiderangingimmigrationcrackdownhisadministrationhastriedtorevokestudentvisasandgreencardsofforeignstudentswhoparticipatedinpropalestinianprotestshehasundertakenanextraordinaryefforttorevampprivatecollegesandschoolsacrosstheusclaimingtheyfosterantiamericanmarxistandradicalleftideologieshehascriticizedharvardforhiringprominentdemocratsforteachingorleadershippositionstheusdepartmentofhealthandhumanservicessaidonmondaythatitwasterminatingafurthermillioninfederalgrantstoharvardbecauseitfailedtoaddressantisemiticharassmentandethnicdiscriminationinalegalcomplaintfiledearlierthismonthharvardsaiditwascommittedtocombatingantisemitismandhadtakenstepstoensureitscampusissafeandwelcomingtojewishandisraelistudentsaaronreichlinmelnickaseniorfellowwiththeamericanimmigrationcouncilaproimmigrationadvocacygroupsaidtheactionagainstharvardisstudentvisaprogramneedlesslypunishesthousandsofinnocentstudentsnoneofthemhavedoneanythingwrongtheyarejustcollateraldamagetotrumphesaidonthesocialmediasiteblueskyeabeaeaaeabeeabeaaeabeaeabeaeaceabeeaaeabfeafeaeabeaeaceabeeaaeaeafeaaeabfeabeabeeaaaeaaealaughingeaaeabeeaaceabfeaealaughingeaaeabfeaaeabeafeabeaeaaeabeeaaceabeeabeabfeaaeaeafeaaeeaaeaeabeaaeabeaaceabfeabeafeaeabeaaeealaughingeaaaeaeaealaughingeaaeabeaaceaeaaeabeeaa

"Chittagong University (CU) has withdrawn the two-year suspension order for six out of nine female students, who were suspended over allegations of assaulting a teacher and harassing a journalist. The suspension period for the remaining three students has been reduced to six months from two years by the university administration. The decision was made yesterday during a meeting of the university's Board of Residence, Health and Disciplinary Committee. Confirming the development, CU Pro-Vice Chancellor (Administration) Professor Dr Kamal Uddin told The Daily Star that the suspension orders for the six students were withdrawn as they admitted their wrongdoing and apologised. The other three have been given a six-month suspension, effective from February 13, he said. During this suspension period, if any of the students participate in exams, their results will be considered invalid. Initially, their dormitory seats have also been cancelled, he added. One of the suspended students, Sumaiya Sikder, said, ""I didn't do anything wrong in the February 5 incident, nor did I misbehave with any teacher. Why should I admit guilt? The administration has pardoned those who admitted guilt. Since we didn't, we received a six-month suspension. We haven't received the official letter yet; once we do, we will decide our next steps."" On February 5, allegations surfaced of teachers being assaulted and journalists being harassed following the vandalism of the boat symbol and the mural of former prime minister Sheikh Hasina at the university's Bijoy 24 (formerly Sheikh Hasina) Hall. Following a Syndicate meeting on February 13, the university administration had permanently expelled one student and suspended nine others for two years. The six students whose suspension orders were withdrawn are Elisa Swarna Chowdhury (Department of Oceanography), Umme Habiba Brishti (Department of Criminology), Fawzia Ahmed Polly Majumder (Department of Communication and Journalism), Farzana Yasmin Putul (Department of Banking and Insurance), Fatematuz Ashfia Nahar Esha (Institute of Fine Arts), and Maisara Jahan Isha (Department of Oceanography). The three students who remain suspended for six months are Rojatul Jannat Nisha (Department of Criminology), Jannatul Mawa Mithila (Department of Criminology), and Mosammat Sumaiya Sikder (Department of Marketing). Additionally, the permanent expulsion of Afshana Enayet Emi, a student from the Department of Law, has been upheld for allegedly assaulting an assistant proctor. সেনাসদর আরও জানিয়েছে, জাতীয় নিরাপত্তা বিঘ্নিত হয়, সেনাবাহিনী এমন কোনো বিষয়ে সম্পৃক্ত হবে না।",2025-05-22T05:06:20Z,chittagonguniversitycuhaswithdrawnthetwoyearsuspensionorderforsixoutofninefemalestudentswhoweresuspendedoverallegationsofassaultingateacherandharassingajournalistthesuspensionperiodfortheremainingthreestudentshasbeenreducedtosixmonthsfromtwoyearsbytheuniversityadministrationthedecisionwasmadeyesterdayduringameetingoftheuniversityisboardofresidencehealthanddisciplinarycommitteeconfirmingthedevelopmentcuprovicechancelloradministrationprofessordrkamaluddintoldthedailystarthatthesuspensionordersforthesixstudentswerewithdrawnastheyadmittedtheirwrongdoingandapologisedtheotherthreehavebeengivenasixmonthsuspensioneffectivefromfebruaryhesaidduringthissuspensionperiodifanyofthestudentsparticipateinexamstheirresultswillbeconsideredinvalidinitiallytheirdormitoryseatshavealsobeencancelledheaddedoneofthesuspendedstudentssumaiyasikdersaidididnotdoanythingwronginthefebruaryincidentnordidimisbehavewithanyteacherwhyshouldiadmitguilttheadministrationhaspardonedthosewhoadmittedguiltsincewedidnotwereceivedasixmonthsuspensionwehavenotreceivedtheofficialletteryetoncewedowewilldecideournextstepsonfebruaryallegationssurfacedofteachersbeingassaultedandjournalistsbeingharassedfollowingthevandalismoftheboatsymbolandthemuralofformerprimeministersheikhhasinaattheuniversityisbijoyformerlysheikhhasinahallfollowingasyndicatemeetingonfebruarytheuniversityadministrationhadpermanentlyetonguestickingoutelledonestudentandsuspendednineothersfortwoyearsthesixstudentswhosesuspensionorderswerewithdrawnareelisaswarnachowdhurydepartmentofoceanographyummehabibabrishtidepartmentofcriminologyfawziaahmedpollymajumderdepartmentofcommunicationandjournalismfarzanayasminputuldepartmentofbankingandinsurancefatematuzashfianahareshainstituteoffineartsandmaisarajahanishadepartmentofoceanographythethreestudentswhoremainsuspendedforsixmonthsarerojatuljannatnishadepartmentofcriminologyjannatulmawamithiladepartmentofcriminologyandmosammatsumaiyasikderdepartmentofmarketingadditionallythepermanentetonguestickingoutulsionofafshanaenayetemiastudentfromthedepartmentoflawhasbeenupheldforallegedlyassaultinganassistantproctoreabeaeaaeabeeabeaaeabeaeabeaeaceabeeaaeabfeafeaeabeaeaceabeeaaeaeafeaaeabfeabeabeeaaaeaaealaughingeaaeabeeaaceabfeaealaughingeaaeabfeaaeabeafeabeaeaaeabeeaaceabeeabeabfeaaeaeafeaaeeaaeaeabeaaeabeaaceabfeabeafeaeabeaaeealaughingeaaaeaeaealaughingeaaeabeaaceaeaaeabeeaa
"Managing finances within academic institutions is often a fragmented and complicated process. Students, parents, teachers, and institutions frequently rely on multiple, disconnected banking services—resulting in operational challenges and missed opportunities for tailored financial support. PrimeAcademia, Prime Bank's latest innovation, addresses this gap by offering a unified and comprehensive financial solution for all educational stakeholders under one integrated platform. This initiative is particularly vital in a country where around 30 million people remain unbanked, and nearly 72 percent of the population lacks basic financial literacy. What is PrimeAcademia PrimeAcademia is a comprehensive banking platform tailored to the unique financial needs of academic institutions, their staffs, students, and parents. Developed by Prime Bank PLC., the solution simplifies financial management through services like digital fee collection, payroll processing, tailored savings accounts, and education-focused loans. It includes institutional accounts with competitive interest or profit options, insurance-backed savings plans for teachers, and loan facilities for parents, ensuring that financial support is accessible at every level of the academic ecosystem. What kind of services does PrimeAcademia offer? PrimeAcademia provides a full suite of services to streamline financial operations in educational institutions both in Conventional and Islamic Banking mode. These include: • Profit or interest-bearing current accounts offering competitive rates up to 4 percent p.a. • Digital fee collection through prime bank owned software 'prime collect' beyond the mobile financial services, debit/credit cards, mobile apps and internet banking. • Tools for bulk and individual salary disbursements, VAT/tax payments, and government dues. • Investment and financing options for institutions. Teachers receive dedicated savings accounts with attractive returns up to 5 percent p.a. and insurance coverage up to BDT 3 lac. They also benefit from personal and professional loan facilities along with pre-approved credit card. Students are offered youth-targeted savings accounts—earning 5 percent p.a returns for those under 18 and 4 percent p.a for those above. PrimeAcademia also provides student file services to aid in studying abroad. Parents can access education loans and investment options to ease tuition and academic expenses. With these features, PrimeAcademia emerges as a robust, one-stop banking solution for the academic sector. Why PrimeAcademia is a timely initiative In today's digital world, efficiency and accessibility in banking are not luxuries—they are necessities. With educational institutions managing a complex array of financial responsibilities, the need for an integrated solution has never been greater. ""We view young people as catalysts for inclusive growth. PrimeAcademia helps them access tailored banking services and practical financial education, unlocking their potential for lifelong success,"" says M M Mahbub Hasan, Head of Financial Inclusion and School Banking at Prime Bank PLC. The situation is particularly pressing in Bangladesh, where the youth population stands at 46 million, and over 4.7 million of them are university students. Alarmingly, a significant portion of this group still lacks basic financial literacy. Given that youth comprise 36.53 percent of the total workforce, their financial empowerment is not only a personal need but a national priority. By streamlining banking for students, staff, and parents, PrimeAcademia simplifies financial operations while promoting financial inclusion and economic participation. A crucial step toward financial literacy Many students complete their education without acquiring essential financial knowledge—an oversight with long-term consequences. PrimeAcademia aims to change that by instilling responsible financial habits and offering practical tools early in life. Through youth savings accounts and financial engagement programmes, the initiative encourages saving, budgeting, and informed decision-making—paving the way for a financially literate generation. Transforming academic banking for the future In a sector long constrained by outdated financial systems, PrimeAcademia is a breath of fresh air. It empowers educational institutions with digital solutions and equips students, teachers, and parents with tools for a better financial future. ""Educational institutions are at the heart of social and economic progress. Through PrimeAcademia, we are delivering institution-focused banking solutions and seamless digital integration to support the education sector's financial infrastructure,"" says M Nazeem A Choudhury, Deputy Managing Director at Prime Bank PLC. As Bangladesh looks toward a future shaped by its youth, initiatives like PrimeAcademia are not just innovative—they are essential. সেনাসদর আরও জানিয়েছে, জাতীয় নিরাপত্তা বিঘ্নিত হয়, সেনাবাহিনী এমন কোনো বিষয়ে সম্পৃক্ত হবে না।",2025-05-21T21:24:11Z,managingfinanceswithinacademicinstitutionsisoftenafragmentedandcomplicatedprocessstudentsparentsteachersandinstitutionsfrequentlyrelyonmultipledisconnectedbankingserviceseresultinginoperationalchallengesandmissedopportunitiesfortailoredfinancialsupportprimeacademiaprimebankislatestinnovationaddressesthisgapbyofferingaunifiedandcomprehensivefinancialsolutionforalleducationalstakeholdersunderoneintegratedplatformthisinitiativeisparticularlyvitalinacountrywherearoundmillionpeopleremainunbankedandnearlypercentofthepopulationlacksbasicfinancialliteracywhatisprimeacademiaprimeacademiaisacomprehensivebankingplatformtailoredtotheuniquefinancialneedsofacademicinstitutionstheirstaffsstudentsandparentsdevelopedbyprimebankplcthesolutionsimplifiesfinancialmanagementthroughserviceslikedigitalfeecollectionpayrollprocessingtailoredsavingsaccountsandeducationfocusedloansitincludesinstitutionalaccountswithcompetitiveinterestorprofitoptionsinsurancebackedsavingsplansforteachersandloanfacilitiesforparentsensuringthatfinancialsupportisaccessibleateveryleveloftheacademicecosystemwhatkindofservicesdoesprimeacademiaofferprimeacademiaprovidesafullsuiteofservicestostreamlinefinancialoperationsineducationalinstitutionsbothinconventionalandislamicbankingmodetheseincludeeaprofitorinterestbearingcurrentaccountsofferingcompetitiveratesuptopercentpaeadigitalfeecollectionthroughprimebankownedsoftwareprimecollectbeyondthemobilefinancialservicesdebitcreditcardsmobileappsandinternetbankingeatoolsforbulkandindividualsalarydisbursementsvattaxpaymentsandgovernmentdueseainvestmentandfinancingoptionsforinstitutionsteachersreceivededicatedsavingsaccountswithattractivereturnsuptopercentpaandinsurancecoverageuptobdtlactheyalsobenefitfrompersonalandprofessionalloanfacilitiesalongwithpreapprovedcreditcardstudentsareofferedyouthtargetedsavingsaccountseearningpercentpareturnsforthoseunderandpercentpaforthoseaboveprimeacademiaalsoprovidesstudentfileservicestoaidinstudyingabroadparentscanaccesseducationloansandinvestmentoptionstoeasetuitionandacademicetonguestickingoutenseswiththesefeaturesprimeacademiaemergesasarobustonestopbankingsolutionfortheacademicsectorwhyprimeacademiaisatimelyinitiativeintodayisdigitalworldefficiencyandaccessibilityinbankingarenotluxuriesetheyarenecessitieswitheducationalinstitutionsmanagingacomplexarrayoffinancialresponsibilitiestheneedforanintegratedsolutionhasneverbeengreaterweviewyoungpeopleascatalystsforinclusivegrowthprimeacademiahelpsthemaccesstailoredbankingservicesandpracticalfinancialeducationunlockingtheirpotentialforlifelongsuccesssaysmmmahbubhasanheadoffinancialinclusionandschoolbankingatprimebankplcthesituationisparticularlypressinginbangladeshwheretheyouthpopulationstandsatmillionandovermillionofthemareuniversitystudentsalarminglyasignificantportionofthisgroupstilllacksbasicfinancialliteracygiventhatyouthcomprisepercentofthetotalworkforcetheirfinancialempowermentisnotonlyapersonalneedbutanationalprioritybystreamliningbankingforstudentsstaffandparentsprimeacademiasimplifiesfinancialoperationswhilepromotingfinancialinclusionandeconomicparticipationacrucialsteptowardfinancialliteracymanystudentscompletetheireducationwithoutacquiringessentialfinancialknowledgeeanoversightwithlongtermconsequencesprimeacademiaaimstochangethatbyinstillingresponsiblefinancialhabitsandofferingpracticaltoolsearlyinlifethroughyouthsavingsaccountsandfinancialengagementprogrammestheinitiativeencouragessavingbudgetingandinformeddecisionmakingepavingthewayforafinanciallyliterategenerationtransformingacademicbankingforthefutureinasectorlongconstrainedbyoutdatedfinancialsystemsprimeacademiaisabreathoffreshairitempowerseducationalinstitutionswithdigitalsolutionsandequipsstudentsteachersandparentswithtoolsforabetterfinancialfutureeducationalinstitutionsareattheheartofsocialandeconomicprogressthroughprimeacademiawearedeliveringinstitutionfocusedbankingsolutionsandseamlessdigitalintegrationtosupporttheeducationsectorisfinancialinfrastructuresaysmnazeemachoudhurydeputymanagingdirectoratprimebankplcasbangladeshlookstowardafutureshapedbyitsyouthinitiativeslikeprimeacademiaarenotjustinnovativeetheyareessentialeabeaeaaeabeeabeaaeabeaeabeaeaceabeeaaeabfeafeaeabeaeaceabeeaaeaeafeaaeabfeabeabeeaaaeaaealaughingeaaeabeeaaceabfeaealaughingeaaeabfeaaeabeafeabeaeaaeabeeaaceabeeabeabfeaaeaeafeaaeeaaeaeabeaaeabeaaceabfeabeafeaeabeaaeealaughingeaaaeaeaealaughingeaaeabeaaceaeaaeabeeaa
"The motorsports scene in Bangladesh has long been constrained by limited infrastructure and a lack of formal driver development initiatives. While interest in competitive racing has increased in recent years, the country has historically lacked dedicated racing facilities, standardised coaching systems, and clear progression pathways for aspiring racers. In an effort to address these gaps, the Automobile Association of Bangladesh (AAB) has recently launched the Motorsport Academy, offering structured training programmes designed to develop professional racing talent. The academy currently runs three sequential courses – beginner, intermediate and advanced – each requiring successful completion of exams to progress. When asked about the details of the motorsports training courses, Fahad Gaffoor, Chief Development Officer at AAB and Main Instructor at the academy, explained that the beginner course focuses on motorsport fundamentals rather than driving skills: ""You will be taught the foundations of motorsports – the rules and regulations, safety measures, equipment preparation, and basic car behaviour."" The two-day course concludes with an exam combining multiple-choice questions and simulator-based practical assessments.   The intermediate and advanced courses build on the basic foundations with more technical instructions. ""Intermediate and advanced drivers will be taught to understand the dynamics of a car, including how a race car behaves in different conditions,"" Gaffoor noted. Advanced students also learn data analysis techniques using real-time telemetry from simulators to identify performance improvements, which experienced drivers can use to refine their skills, as Gaffoor explained: ""Using the analysed data, advanced drivers can extract that extra mile and extra second to gain better lap times.""   In the academy, all the practical training takes place on high-end simulators with professional-grade equipment, rather than on an actual race track. ""We use Fanatec Direct Drive steering wheels, which are configured to match real cars,"" said Gaffoor when talking about the simulators. He stated that the academy relies on racing simulation software such as iRacing and Assetto Corsa Competizione, official simulators which can replicate real-world racing physics with high accuracy.  While acknowledging that simulators cannot fully replicate gravitational forces experienced in real-life driving, Gaffoor highlighted their practical advantages using a hypothetical scenario: ""If you wanted to train in rainy conditions, you couldn't do that on a real track unless it happened to rain naturally. But in a simulator, you can create rain conditions immediately."" He noted that even professional Formula 1 drivers regularly use simulators for training. Successful graduates receive tiered racing licenses. The basic qualification permits participation in national grassroots events, while the advanced certification grants eligibility for competitions approved by the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) - the governing organisation of international motorsports. The academy also offers esports licensing, following the FIA's recognition of sim racing as a distinct motorsport category. The academy currently operates physical classes at its esports lounge but plans to introduce hybrid and fully online options from next month. Course fees range from BDT 10,000 for beginners, BDT 18,000 for intermediate learners, and BDT 30,000 for advanced training. Looking ahead, the academy intends to arrange international track experiences for advanced students. ""Eventually, we want to take our most advanced learners to real-world circuits overseas to implement what they've learned in simulators,"" Gaffoor shared, adding that the Automobile Association of Bangladesh (AAB) also organises its own motorsport events, such as the Auto Slalom and Karting Slalom. These local competitions typically attract 200 to 300 participants and serve as platforms for emerging talent to test their skills in divisional and national rounds. Since launching in April 2025, the academy has so far trained four batches of students. With its structured pathway from fundamentals to professional preparation, the initiative aims to develop Bangladesh's motorsport talent pool while making the sport more accessible. ""The objective is to make motorsports available to everyone at a reasonable price,"" Gaffoor emphasised, noting no prior experience is required to begin training. সেনাসদর আরও জানিয়েছে, জাতীয় নিরাপত্তা বিঘ্নিত হয়, সেনাবাহিনী এমন কোনো বিষয়ে সম্পৃক্ত হবে না।",2025-05-26T08:37:20Z,themotorsportssceneinbangladeshhaslongbeenconstrainedbylimitedinfrastructureandalackofformaldriverdevelopmentinitiativeswhileinterestincompetitiveracinghasincreasedinrecentyearsthecountryhashistoricallylackeddedicatedracingfacilitiesstandardisedcoachingsystemsandclearprogressionpathwaysforaspiringracersinanefforttoaddressthesegapstheautomobileassociationofbangladeshaabhasrecentlylaunchedthemotorsportacademyofferingstructuredtrainingprogrammesdesignedtodevelopprofessionalracingtalenttheacademycurrentlyrunsthreesequentialcoursesebeginnerintermediateandadvancedeeachrequiringsuccessfulcompletionofexamstoprogresswhenaskedaboutthedetailsofthemotorsportstrainingcoursesfahadgaffoorchiefdevelopmentofficerataabandmaininstructorattheacademyetonguestickingoutlainedthatthebeginnercoursefocusesonmotorsportfundamentalsratherthandrivingskillsyouwillbetaughtthefoundationsofmotorsportsetherulesandregulationssafetymeasuresequipmentpreparationandbasiccarbehaviourthetwodaycourseconcludeswithanexamcombiningmultiplechoicequestionsandsimulatorbasedpracticalassessmentscacatheintermediateandadvancedcoursesbuildonthebasicfoundationswithmoretechnicalinstructionsintermediateandadvanceddriverswillbetaughttounderstandthedynamicsofacarincludinghowaracecarbehavesindifferentconditionsgaffoornotedadvancedstudentsalsolearndataanalysistechniquesusingrealtimetelemetryfromsimulatorstoidentifyperformanceimprovementswhichetonguestickingouterienceddriverscanusetorefinetheirskillsasgaffooretonguestickingoutlainetonguestickingoutusingtheanalyseddataadvanceddriverscanextractthatextramileandextrasecondtogainbetterlaptimescacaintheacademyallthepracticaltrainingtakesplaceonhighendsimulatorswithprofessionalgradeequipmentratherthanonanactualracetrackweusefanatecdirectdrivesteeringwheelswhichareconfiguredtomatchrealcarssaidgaffoorwhentalkingaboutthesimulatorshestatedthattheacademyreliesonracingsimulationsoftwaresuchasiracingandassettocorsacompetizioneofficialsimulatorswhichcanreplicaterealworldracingphysicswithhighaccuracycawhileacknowledgingthatsimulatorscannotfullyreplicategravitationalforcesetonguestickingouteriencedinreallifedrivinggaffoorhighlightedtheirpracticaladvantagesusingahypotheticalscenarioifyouwantedtotraininrainyconditionsyoucouldnotdothatonarealtrackunlessithappenedtorainnaturallybutinasimulatoryoucancreaterainconditionsimmediatelyhenotedthatevenprofessionalformuladriversregularlyusesimulatorsfortrainingsuccessfulgraduatesreceivetieredracinglicensesthebasicqualificationpermitsparticipationinnationalgrassrootseventswhiletheadvancedcertificationgrantseligibilityforcompetitionsapprovedbythefcadcarationinternationaledelautomobilefiathegoverningorganisationofinternationalmotorsportstheacademyalsooffersesportslicensingfollowingthefiaisrecognitionofsimracingasadistinctmotorsportcategorytheacademycurrentlyoperatesphysicalclassesatitsesportsloungebutplanstointroducehybridandfullyonlineoptionsfromnextmonthcoursefeesrangefrombdtforbeginnersbdtforintermediatelearnersandbdtforadvancedtraininglookingaheadtheacademyintendstoarrangeinternationaltracketonguestickingouteriencesforadvancedstudentseventuallywewanttotakeourmostadvancedlearnerstorealworldcircuitsoverseastoimplementwhattheyhavelearnedinsimulatorsgaffoorsharedaddingthattheautomobileassociationofbangladeshaabalsoorganisesitsownmotorsporteventssuchastheautoslalomandkartingslalomtheselocalcompetitionstypicallyattracttoparticipantsandserveasplatformsforemergingtalenttotesttheirskillsindivisionalandnationalroundssincelaunchinginapriltheacademyhassofartrainedfourbatchesofstudentswithitsstructuredpathwayfromfundamentalstoprofessionalpreparationtheinitiativeaimstodevelopbangladeshismotorsporttalentpoolwhilemakingthesportmoreaccessibletheobjectiveistomakemotorsportsavailabletoeveryoneatareasonablepricegaffooremphasisednotingnoprioretonguestickingouterienceisrequiredtobegintrainingeabeaeaaeabeeabeaaeabeaeabeaeaceabeeaaeabfeafeaeabeaeaceabeeaaeaeafeaaeabfeabeabeeaaaeaaealaughingeaaeabeeaaceabfeaealaughingeaaeabfeaaeabeafeabeaeaaeabeeaaceabeeabeabfeaaeaeafeaaeeaaeaeabeaaeabeaaceabfeabeafeaeabeaaeealaughingeaaaeaeaealaughingeaaeabeaaceaeaaeabeeaa

"Startup Bangladesh Limited (SBL) has unveiled a strategic roadmap focused on strengthening the country's innovation ecosystem on May 24. According to a press release, discussions focused on seven key enablers identified in the report: Accelerators/Incubators, Challenge Funds, Local LP Engagement, Fund Manager Training, Nation Branding, Regulation Advocacy, and Startup Summits. Despite promising early-stage activity, the report highlighted the pressing need to address gaps in the ecosystem. The roadmap outlines a comprehensive action plan tailored to Bangladesh's context, aligning with global best practices and supported by designated implementation leads including Startup Bangladesh and the ICT Division, states the press release by Startup Bangladesh. The roadmap calls for a dual approach: expanding the pipeline of startups entering the ecosystem, and ensuring that those already in operation are better equipped to scale and attract investment. Each of the seven pillars includes specific recommendations to build infrastructure, unlock funding opportunities, and raise Bangladesh's profile as a destination for innovation, as per a press release. With stakeholder input gathered during the session, Startup Bangladesh will begin to roll out the first wave of priority initiatives in alignment with fiscal and operational planning for the next phase. The initiative was formally presented during a stakeholder engagement session held at the ICT Division in Dhaka. The meeting was chaired by Shish Haider Chowdhury, ndc, Secretary of the ICT Division and Chairman of Startup Bangladesh, and brought together representatives from government agencies, investors, academia, development partners, and startup enablers, as per a press release. সেনাসদর আরও জানিয়েছে, জাতীয় নিরাপত্তা বিঘ্নিত হয়, সেনাবাহিনী এমন কোনো বিষয়ে সম্পৃক্ত হবে না।",2025-05-25T07:35:21Z,startupbangladeshlimitedsblhasunveiledastrategicroadmapfocusedonstrengtheningthecountryisinnovationecosystemonmayaccordingtoapressreleasediscussionsfocusedonsevenkeyenablersidentifiedinthereportacceleratorsincubatorschallengefundslocallpengagementfundmanagertrainingnationbrandingregulationadvocacyandstartupsummitsdespitepromisingearlystageactivitythereporthighlightedthepressingneedtoaddressgapsintheecosystemtheroadmapoutlinesacomprehensiveactionplantailoredtobangladeshiscontextaligningwithglobalbestpracticesandsupportedbydesignatedimplementationleadsincludingstartupbangladeshandtheictdivisionstatesthepressreleasebystartupbangladeshtheroadmapcallsforadualapproachetonguestickingoutandingthepipelineofstartupsenteringtheecosystemandensuringthatthosealreadyinoperationarebetterequippedtoscaleandattractinvestmenteachofthesevenpillarsincludesspecificrecommendationstobuildinfrastructureunlockfundingopportunitiesandraisebangladeshisprofileasadestinationforinnovationasperapressreleasewithstakeholderinputgatheredduringthesessionstartupbangladeshwillbegintorolloutthefirstwaveofpriorityinitiativesinalignmentwithfiscalandoperationalplanningforthenextphasetheinitiativewasformallypresentedduringastakeholderengagementsessionheldattheictdivisionindhakathemeetingwaschairedbyshishhaiderchowdhuryndcsecretaryoftheictdivisionandchairmanofstartupbangladeshandbroughttogetherrepresentativesfromgovernmentagenciesinvestorsacademiadevelopmentpartnersandstartupenablersasperapressreleaseeabeaeaaeabeeabeaaeabeaeabeaeaceabeeaaeabfeafeaeabeaeaceabeeaaeaeafeaaeabfeabeabeeaaaeaaealaughingeaaeabeeaaceabfeaealaughingeaaeabfeaaeabeafeabeaeaaeabeeaaceabeeabeabfeaaeaeafeaaeeaaeaeabeaaeabeaaceabfeabeafeaeabeaaeealaughingeaaaeaeaealaughingeaaeabeaaceaeaaeabeeaa
"Zabeer Zarif Akhter, a student from St. Joseph Higher Secondary School, Dhaka, has been awarded the Stockholm Junior Water Prize Bangladesh 2025. Having won the same national title last year, Zabeer will once again represent Bangladesh at the global finals in Stockholm during World Water Week, competing against national champions from other countries. Zabeer's award-winning project, titled 'AI-Based Rapid Water Testing System', utilises AI (artificial intelligence), machine learning, and IoT (Internet of Things) technology to address challenges in water safety monitoring. The project's focus corresponds with Sustainable Development Goal 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation), which serves as the theme for the Stockholm Junior Water Prize competition. According to Zabeer, his low-cost, portable device offers real-time water quality monitoring, delivering results within seconds and with 97% accuracy. At the heart of this innovation is the ESP32-C6 microcontroller, which enables the device to conduct advanced tests using UV, IR, Raman spectroscopy, and electrical measurements to detect contaminants like heavy metals, volatile organic compounds, and pathogens. Zabeer says that this technology promises a scalable solution to water safety, especially in rural and disaster-prone areas where traditional lab testing is costly, slow, or completely inaccessible. ""Unsafe water remains a critical issue, particularly in regions with little to no access to laboratory facilities. With this system, individuals and organisations can get accurate contamination data in real-time, empowering them to take immediate action,"" Zabeer explained. His journey to Stockholm began last year when he first won the national round of the same competition with a project on water purification, which involved the use of plasma and high voltage to create a water purifier from electronic waste. This year, he says he took things one step further, shifting from purification to prevention and detection. This year's project complements his previous work by offering ""a diagnostic layer that can preemptively alert users to contamination before it causes harm"". ""I want to create a complete ecosystem around water safety, from detection to purification. That is why this year's project is focused on rapid testing. If you do not know if your water is unsafe, you cannot take steps to purify it,"" he added. Zabeer anticipates this year's trip to Sweden with particular interest, as it will include meetings with the Swedish Royal Family and attendance at the Stockholm City Hall dinner traditionally held for Nobel Laureates. The itinerary also provides opportunities to interact with other national winners and discuss their respective projects. Regarding the international competition, he noted the value of collaborating with global peers working on similar water-related challenges, stating: ""There is so much to learn from young people around the world who are working on the same issue. It is a reminder that innovation does not need age but urgency."" Furthermore, Zabeer is committed to taking his project into the real world. ""This is not just a science fair project but a real solution. I am working on partnerships to bring it to the people who need it most,"" he emphasised. He is currently exploring collaborations with institutions such as BUET, NGOs like WaterAid and UNICEF, and public health departments to expand field testing and optimise the device's scalability. His vision includes rolling out his system in disaster-hit zones, industrial belts, and rural communities, where fast, on-the-ground water testing could be the difference between sickness and safety. Zabeer also says that his current project is supported by a collaborative ecosystem of partners committed to water innovation and youth-led solutions. House of Volunteers served as the national organiser, with WaterAid Bangladesh co-organising the competition. Strategic support came from ITN-BUET and UNICEF, while ES Tex acted as the technical partner, he added. সেনাসদর আরও জানিয়েছে, জাতীয় নিরাপত্তা বিঘ্নিত হয়, সেনাবাহিনী এমন কোনো বিষয়ে সম্পৃক্ত হবে না।",2025-05-25T06:36:11Z,zabeerzarifakhterastudentfromstjosephhighersecondaryschooldhakahasbeenawardedthestockholmjuniorwaterprizebangladeshhavingwonthesamenationaltitlelastyearzabeerwillonceagainrepresentbangladeshattheglobalfinalsinstockholmduringworldwaterweekcompetingagainstnationalchampionsfromothercountrieszabeerisawardwinningprojecttitledaibasedrapidwatertestingsystemutilisesaiartificialintelligencemachinelearningandiotinternetofthingstechnologytoaddresschallengesinwatersafetymonitoringtheprojectisfocuscorrespondswithsustainabledevelopmentgoalcleanwaterandsanitationwhichservesasthethemeforthestockholmjuniorwaterprizecompetitionaccordingtozabeerhislowcostportabledeviceoffersrealtimewaterqualitymonitoringdeliveringresultswithinsecondsandwithaccuracyattheheartofthisinnovationistheespcmicrocontrollerwhichenablesthedevicetoconductadvancedtestsusinguvirramanspectroscopyandelectricalmeasurementstodetectcontaminantslikeheavymetalsvolatileorganiccompoundsandpathogenszabeersaysthatthistechnologypromisesascalablesolutiontowatersafetyespeciallyinruralanddisasterproneareaswheretraditionallabtestingiscostlysloworcompletelyinaccessibleunsafewaterremainsacriticalissueparticularlyinregionswithlittletonoaccesstolaboratoryfacilitieswiththissystemindividualsandorganisationscangetaccuratecontaminationdatainrealtimeempoweringthemtotakeimmediateactionzabeeretonguestickingoutlainedhisjourneytostockholmbeganlastyearwhenhefirstwonthenationalroundofthesamecompetitionwithaprojectonwaterpurificationwhichinvolvedtheuseofplasmaandhighvoltagetocreateawaterpurifierfromelectronicwastethisyearhesayshetookthingsonestepfurthershiftingfrompurificationtopreventionanddetectionthisyearisprojectcomplementshispreviousworkbyofferingadiagnosticlayerthatcanpreemptivelyalertuserstocontaminationbeforeitcausesharmiwanttocreateacompleteecosystemaroundwatersafetyfromdetectiontopurificationthatiswhythisyearisprojectisfocusedonrapidtestingifyoudonotknowifyourwaterisunsafeyoucannottakestepstopurifyitheaddedzabeeranticipatesthisyearistriptoswedenwithparticularinterestasitwillincludemeetingswiththeswedishroyalfamilyandattendanceatthestockholmcityhalldinnertraditionallyheldfornobellaureatestheitineraryalsoprovidesopportunitiestointeractwithothernationalwinnersanddiscusstheirrespectiveprojectsregardingtheinternationalcompetitionhenotedthevalueofcollaboratingwithglobalpeersworkingonsimilarwaterrelatedchallengesstatingthereissomuchtolearnfromyoungpeoplearoundtheworldwhoareworkingonthesameissueitisareminderthatinnovationdoesnotneedagebuturgencyfurthermorezabeeriscommittedtotakinghisprojectintotherealworldthisisnotjustasciencefairprojectbutarealsolutioniamworkingonpartnershipstobringittothepeoplewhoneeditmostheemphasisedheiscurrentlyetonguestickingoutloringcollaborationswithinstitutionssuchasbuetngoslikewateraidandunicefandpublichealthdepartmentstoetonguestickingoutandfieldtestingandoptimisethedeviceisscalabilityhisvisionincludesrollingouthissystemindisasterhitzonesindustrialbeltsandruralcommunitieswherefastonthegroundwatertestingcouldbethedifferencebetweensicknessandsafetyzabeeralsosaysthathiscurrentprojectissupportedbyacollaborativeecosystemofpartnerscommittedtowaterinnovationandyouthledsolutionshouseofvolunteersservedasthenationalorganiserwithwateraidbangladeshcsurpriserganisingthecompetitionstrategicsupportcamefromitnbuetandunicefwhileestexactedasthetechnicalpartnerheaddedeabeaeaaeabeeabeaaeabeaeabeaeaceabeeaaeabfeafeaeabeaeaceabeeaaeaeafeaaeabfeabeabeeaaaeaaealaughingeaaeabeeaaceabfeaealaughingeaaeabfeaaeabeafeabeaeaaeabeeaaceabeeabeabfeaaeaeafeaaeeaaeaeabeaaeabeaaceabfeabeafeaeabeaaeealaughingeaaaeaeaealaughingeaaeabeaaceaeaaeabeeaa
"The website of Evaly, a controversial Bangladeshi e-commerce platform, appeared to have been compromised on 24 May, with a message allegedly left by a hacker claiming possession of the platform's customer data and demanding contact from company staff. As of the morning of 24 May 2025, visitors to Evaly's website were greeted by a stark message in capital letters reading, ""HACKED, I HAVE ALL CUSTOMER DATA. EVALY STAFF PLEASE CONTACT [email protected].""  The message also contained an ultimatum threatening to release the data publicly if the individual behind the breach is not contacted. ""OR ELSE I WILL RELEASE THIS DATA TO THE PUBLIC,"" it read. The extent of the breach, including what specific data may have been accessed or whether it includes sensitive financial or personal information, has not yet been independently verified. Evaly has not issued a formal statement regarding the incident. The hacking incident follows renewed legal scrutiny of the company and its founders. Just weeks earlier, on 13 April 2025, Bangladesh Sangbad Sangstha (BSS), the state-run news agency, reported that a Dhaka court had sentenced Evaly's managing director, Mohammad Rassel, and chairperson, Shamima Nasrin, to three years of rigorous imprisonment in a fraud case. The verdict was delivered by Dhaka Metropolitan Magistrate M Misbah Ur Rahman, who also imposed fines of Tk 5,000 each on the defendants. Arrest warrants were issued after the ruling.  According to BSS, the case was filed by a customer, Md Rajib, who claimed to have paid BDT 12.37 lakh for five motorcycles that were never delivered. The purchase had been made through Evaly's online platform, which was known for its aggressive marketing campaigns and promises of steep discounts. সেনাসদর আরও জানিয়েছে, জাতীয় নিরাপত্তা বিঘ্নিত হয়, সেনাবাহিনী এমন কোনো বিষয়ে সম্পৃক্ত হবে না।",2025-05-24T10:17:13Z,thewebsiteofevalyacontroversialbangladeshiecommerceplatformappearedtohavebeencompromisedonmaywithamessageallegedlyleftbyahackerclaimingpossessionoftheplatformiscustomerdataanddemandingcontactfromcompanystaffasofthemorningofmayvisitorstoevalyiswebsiteweregreetedbyastarkmessageincapitallettersreadinghackedihaveallcustomerdataevalystaffpleasecontactemailcaprotectedcathemessagealsocontainedanultimatumthreateningtoreleasethedatapubliclyiftheindividualbehindthebreachisnotcontactedorelseiwillreleasethisdatatothepublicitreadtheextentofthebreachincludingwhatspecificdatamayhavebeenaccessedorwhetheritincludessensitivefinancialorpersonalinformationhasnotyetbeenindependentlyverifiedevalyhasnotissuedaformalstatementregardingtheincidentthehackingincidentfollowsrenewedlegalscrutinyofthecompanyanditsfoundersjustweeksearlieronaprilbangladeshsangbadsangsthabssthestaterunnewsagencyreportedthatadhakacourthadsentencedevalyismanagingdirectormohammadrasselandchairpersonshamimanasrintothreeyearsofrigorousimprisonmentinafraudcasetheverdictwasdeliveredbydhakametropolitanmagistratemmisbahurrahmanwhoalsoimposedfinesoftkeachonthedefendantsarrestwarrantswereissuedaftertherulingcaaccordingtobssthecasewasfiledbyacustomermdrajibwhoclaimedtohavepaidbdtlakhforfivemotorcyclesthatwereneverdeliveredthepurchasehadbeenmadethroughevalyisonlineplatformwhichwasknownforitsaggressivemarketingcampaignsandpromisesofsteepdiscountseabeaeaaeabeeabeaaeabeaeabeaeaceabeeaaeabfeafeaeabeaeaceabeeaaeaeafeaaeabfeabeabeeaaaeaaealaughingeaaeabeeaaceabfeaealaughingeaaeabfeaaeabeafeabeaeaaeabeeaaceabeeabeabfeaaeaeafeaaeeaaeaeabeaaeabeaaceabfeabeafeaeabeaaeealaughingeaaaeaeaealaughingeaaeabeaaceaeaaeabeeaa
"An international law enforcement effort led by European, North American and British authorities has dismantled a malware distribution network, neutralising more than 300 servers and seizing 3.5 million euros in cryptocurrency, according to a recent report by Reuters. The operation, coordinated under the code name 'Operation Endgame', targeted so-called ""initial access malware,"" a class of malicious software used by cybercriminals to gain an initial foothold in victims' systems. Authorities from Germany, France, the Netherlands, Denmark, the United Kingdom, the United States and Canada were involved in this phase of the investigation, which saw arrests, server takedowns and domain seizures across multiple jurisdictions.  Eurojust, the European Union Agency for Criminal Justice Cooperation, said in a statement that more than three dozen individuals had been identified, with 20 of them now facing criminal charges. International arrest warrants have been issued for all suspects. Law enforcement agencies shut down over 300 servers used to deliver or control the malware and took offline 650 domain names associated with the criminal infrastructure. Since Operation Endgame began in 2024, total seizures now stand at over 21 million euros, as per the Reuters report. German investigators are expected to place 18 of the principal suspects on the EU's Most Wanted list. Authorities have also launched public appeals to help locate those still at large. This week's coordinated enforcement action follows earlier operations in May 2024, which targeted botnets in what was then the largest crackdown of its kind.  Officials have indicated that further enforcement actions and updates will be announced through a dedicated website. সেনাসদর আরও জানিয়েছে, জাতীয় নিরাপত্তা বিঘ্নিত হয়, সেনাবাহিনী এমন কোনো বিষয়ে সম্পৃক্ত হবে না।",2025-05-24T11:23:49Z,aninternationallawenforcementeffortledbyeuropeannorthamericanandbritishauthoritieshasdismantledamalwaredistributionnetworkneutralisingmorethanserversandseizingmillioneurosincryptocurrencyaccordingtoarecentreportbyreuterstheoperationcoordinatedunderthecodenameoperationendgametargetedsocalledinitialaccessmalwareaclassofmalicioussoftwareusedbycybercriminalstogainaninitialfootholdinvictimssystemsauthoritiesfromgermanyfrancethenetherlandsdenmarktheunitedkingdomtheunitedstatesandcanadawereinvolvedinthisphaseoftheinvestigationwhichsawarrestsservertakedownsanddomainseizuresacrossmultiplejurisdictionscaeurojusttheeuropeanunionagencyforcriminaljusticecooperationsaidinastatementthatmorethanthreedozenindividualshadbeenidentifiedwithofthemnowfacingcriminalchargesinternationalarrestwarrantshavebeenissuedforallsuspectslawenforcementagenciesshutdownoverserversusedtodeliverorcontrolthemalwareandtookofflinedomainnamesassociatedwiththecriminalinfrastructuresinceoperationendgamebeganintotalseizuresnowstandatovermillioneurosasperthereutersreportgermaninvestigatorsareetonguestickingoutectedtoplaceoftheprincipalsuspectsontheeuismostwantedlistauthoritieshavealsolaunchedpublicappealstohelplocatethosestillatlargethisweekiscoordinatedenforcementactionfollowsearlieroperationsinmaywhichtargetedbotnetsinwhatwasthenthelargestcrackdownofitskindcaofficialshaveindicatedthatfurtherenforcementactionsandupdateswillbeannouncedthroughadedicatedwebsiteeabeaeaaeabeeabeaaeabeaeabeaeaceabeeaaeabfeafeaeabeaeaceabeeaaeaeafeaaeabfeabeabeeaaaeaaealaughingeaaeabeeaaceabfeaealaughingeaaeabfeaaeabeafeabeaeaaeabeeaaceabeeabeabfeaaeaeafeaaeeaaeaeabeaaeabeaaceabfeabeafeaeabeaaeealaughingeaaaeaeaealaughingeaaeabeaaceaeaaeabeeaa
"Vietnam's Ministry of Information and Communications has instructed domestic telecommunication service providers to block access to the messaging platform Telegram, citing the app's alleged failure to cooperate with authorities in addressing criminal activities, according to a recent report by Reuters.  The directive, dated May 21 and signed by a senior telecoms official, requires providers to implement the ban and report back to the ministry by June 2. The order follows an assessment from the country's cybersecurity department, which claims that a majority of Telegram's channels and groups operating in Vietnam are being used for illegal purposes. According to a government report seen by Reuters, authorities allege that 68 percent of the 9,600 Telegram groups in the country have engaged in unlawful activities, including fraud, drug trafficking, and content suspected to be linked to terrorism. In the official document, the ministry asked service providers ""to deploy solutions and measures to prevent Telegram's activities in Vietnam,"" citing national security concerns and the need to clamp down on online crime. The Vietnamese government later confirmed the decision via its public web portal. In response, Telegram said it was caught off guard by the government's position. ""Telegram is surprised by those statements,"" a company representative told Reuters on Friday. The representative insisted that the company has responded to all legal requests from Vietnamese authorities within the appropriate timeframes. A government official told Reuters that the move to block Telegram follows the app's refusal to share user data when requested by law enforcement during criminal investigations.  Despite the announcement, Telegram remained accessible in Vietnam as of Friday, states the Reuters report. The Vietnamese government has increasingly intensified scrutiny of digital platforms, pushing for greater accountability and compliance with local laws. The ruling Communist Party has long maintained a tight grip on the media and online discourse, often calling on global tech firms such as Facebook, YouTube, and TikTok to remove content it deems offensive, false, or anti-state, according to the report by Reuters. সেনাসদর আরও জানিয়েছে, জাতীয় নিরাপত্তা বিঘ্নিত হয়, সেনাবাহিনী এমন কোনো বিষয়ে সম্পৃক্ত হবে না।",2025-05-24T09:13:05Z,vietnamisministryofinformationandcommunicationshasinstructeddomestictelecommunicationserviceproviderstoblockaccesstothemessagingplatformtelegramcitingtheappisallegedfailuretocooperatewithauthoritiesinaddressingcriminalactivitiesaccordingtoarecentreportbyreuterscathedirectivedatedmayandsignedbyaseniortelecomsofficialrequiresproviderstoimplementthebanandreportbacktotheministrybyjunetheorderfollowsanassessmentfromthecountryiscybersecuritydepartmentwhichclaimsthatamajorityoftelegramischannelsandgroupsoperatinginvietnamarebeingusedforillegalpurposesaccordingtoagovernmentreportseenbyreutersauthoritiesallegethatpercentofthetelegramgroupsinthecountryhaveengagedinunlawfulactivitiesincludingfrauddrugtraffickingandcontentsuspectedtobelinkedtoterrorismintheofficialdocumenttheministryaskedserviceproviderstodeploysolutionsandmeasurestopreventtelegramisactivitiesinvietnamcitingnationalsecurityconcernsandtheneedtoclampdownononlinecrimethevietnamesegovernmentlaterconfirmedthedecisionviaitspublicwebportalinresponsetelegramsaiditwascaughtoffguardbythegovernmentispositiontelegramissurprisedbythosestatementsacompanyrepresentativetoldreutersonfridaytherepresentativeinsistedthatthecompanyhasrespondedtoalllegalrequestsfromvietnameseauthoritieswithintheappropriatetimeframesagovernmentofficialtoldreutersthatthemovetoblocktelegramfollowstheappisrefusaltoshareuserdatawhenrequestedbylawenforcementduringcriminalinvestigationscadespitetheannouncementtelegramremainedaccessibleinvietnamasoffridaystatesthereutersreportthevietnamesegovernmenthasincreasinglyintensifiedscrutinyofdigitalplatformspushingforgreateraccountabilityandcompliancewithlocallawstherulingcommunistpartyhaslongmaintainedatightgriponthemediaandonlinediscourseoftencallingonglobaltechfirmssuchasfacebookyoutubeandtiktoktoremovecontentitdeemsoffensivefalseorantistateaccordingtothereportbyreuterseabeaeaaeabeeabeaaeabeaeabeaeaceabeeaaeabfeafeaeabeaeaceabeeaaeaeafeaaeabfeabeabeeaaaeaaealaughingeaaeabeeaaceabfeaealaughingeaaeabfeaaeabeafeabeaeaaeabeeaaceabeeabeabfeaaeaeafeaaeeaaeaeabeaaeabeaaceabfeabeafeaeabeaaeealaughingeaaaeaeaealaughingeaaeabeaaceaeaaeabeeaa
"Tumi jokhon eshechile I was still sleeping when you came,
when you sought, flowers were yet to bloom.
When my skies darkened,
dawn broke at your end.
A bright youth, when you came,
my mind was yet to mellow;
the window was closed,
when the full moon peeped.
Now in a dark room, I keep awake alone—
when will you come again, the moon?
Nowadays I cannot sleep,
flowers have bloomed in the garden,
and with the garland you left,
I've knotted my splendid plait.
I was still sleeping when you came . . .  Kaveri nadir jole kego balika Who are you, O damsel, in Kaveri waters
Absentmindedly floating magnolias and jasmines?
Languidly coming to bathe in the morning,
She plays the pitcher with bangles;
The wind plays with flowers in her plaits. 
The sun rises in the horizon,
The water implores empathy,
By the bank of the Jhelum river,
The angel looks for you,
The dark beauty of Karnataka.  Rohi rohi keno shey mukh pore mone Over and over why does the face I ignored
Heartlessly and pointlessly come to my mind?
In a forlorn summer noon,
The mind craves to fly far away.
In the guise of a beggar, eyes wet with tears,
He aroused empathy in the woods—
His heart had thirst, my pitcher had water. 
Failing to get water, the thirsty singing bird
Fell down fast at the early morn. 
I scattered flowers of his garland on dust
But can't let slip the agony from memory. 
Why does the one whom I didn't own forever
Weep furtively in deep anguish from heart.

"Trigger warning: Animal abuse, violence Our Ullash is quite the curious young boy, brimming with boundless energy and an insatiable thirst for discovery. We had always believed he was destined to become a great scientist, someone who would make groundbreaking contributions. Once, he caught hold of a cat and embarked on an experiment so peculiar, it left us speechless. And that wasn't the only time—his antics extended to countless other endeavours. If I were to recount just the cat episode in detail, you'd easily imagine the rest of his escapades. The cat was more than just a pet; it was part of our family. It had been with us since birth, growing up in this very house. With a quiet sense of duty, it took charge of the kitchen, ensuring no other feline dared to trespass while it stood guard. When Ullash decided to choose the cat for one of his experiments, our borobhabi, Ullash's mother, didn't raise a single objection. She simply said, ""Why not? It's been with us for so long. If it proves useful, let it be. But make sure no harm comes to it."" Our elder brother, full of pride in Ullash's inventive streak, promptly hired a carpenter to craft a sturdy cage. He couldn't contain his delight, often bragging to his friends, ""You know, our Ullash is always up to something! He's done this, he's done that!"" And as his uncle, I'm no less guilty of spinning tales of his ingenuity. The cat was placed in a cage, and what followed was nothing short of royal treatment for an entire month. As per Ullash's instructions, we dutifully fetched all manner of delicacies from the market. Lounging in comfort, the cat grew so large and imposing, it began to resemble a miniature tiger. Inside the cage, it roared and raged as though the jungle itself trembled at its might. One day, Ullash gathered us all and said, ""Do you believe now that the cat is the tiger's little brother?"" We'd always entertained the notion, but now, staring at this ferocious creature, it felt undeniably true. Hearing our awe, Ullash added with a sly grin, ""But do you know the cat has a special connection with mice, too? I'll show you that next. For the coming month, it won't be fed."" Aghast, his mother cried out in a trembling voice, ""What? It'll die!"" ""Ma, if you don't understand something, don't bother speaking about it,"" Ullash declared sharply. None of us argued further; we each retreated to our own rooms in silence. Meanwhile, he continued trying to convince our elder brother and sister-in-law. ""Listen, nothing will happen to the cat. And even if it does—so what? Sacrifices like these are nothing new in the name of discovery. Haven't you heard the story of Laika? That dog was sent into space with just a week's worth of food. Yes, she died after a few days, but do you have any idea what her journey accomplished? Laika's name is now immortalised in the annals of history. Imagine that—immortality for a dog! Can you or I hope for such a legacy?"" That's when our elder brother had a sudden flash of inspiration: the cat needed a fitting name. If Ullash truly achieved something remarkable, the cat's name would be celebrated alongside his, immortalised in the glory of his success. ""Tell me, won't Ullash grow up to be someone great?"" ""Of course, no question about it,"" replied the elder brother, his deep voice affirming his wife's hopes and adding to her enthusiasm. Soon, the two drifted off to sleep, chatting happily about the future. The rest of us remained busy with our own lives, Ullash with his. My Borobhai worked in customs, earning handsomely with both hands, so no one worried about Ullash's future. Now and then, when I had a free moment, I'd stop by Ullash's room. Sometimes, he'd greet me with, ""Kaku, come in! I have something new to show you."" Other times, he'd dismiss me with a wave, saying, ""Kaku, not now—come back later."" A month later, he arranged to exhibit the cat. Just seeing it alive filled Brobhabi with an almost boundless joy. But what sort of life was this? The cat's body had withered to the point of resembling a stiff wooden frame. Its legs were as thin as a sparrow's, its skin barely clung to its protruding bones. Anyone unfamiliar with its earlier appearance would have mistaken it for a rat. Even its head drooped forward slightly, like a rodent's. ""Have you given it no food or water?"" Bhabi asked, her voice sharp with disbelief. ""The mouse experiment is over,"" he replied flatly. ""For the next 15 days, it won't get a thing to eat. After that, I'll begin a new experiment with it.""  ""But will it survive?"" ""Oh, stop babbling, ma. Just go. You've done your part."" One morning, about a week later, Bilur ma let out a shriek that could have brought the house down. When I rushed over, I found her wailing, hands on her head, her face a picture of despair. She had opened the deep freezer to move a packet of meat, only to discover the frozen, solid form of the cat—icy and unyielding, like a chunk of meat itself. Bhabi immediately summoned Ullash. It turned out the cat had been trapped in the freezer for five days. Five whole days! What a disaster! Ullash, unfazed, pulled out the frozen cat and said, ""Bilur ma, heat some water on the stove."" ""What on earth are you planning to do?"" Bhabi asked, bewildered. ""It'll be fine with a little boiling. You'll see—it'll start moving again,"" Ullash replied, with a confidence no logic could penetrate. He boiled it for about an hour and then set it out in the sun to dry. By the afternoon, Ullash called everyone up to the rooftop, beaming with pride. ""Look closely,"" he said, holding up the cat. ""Can you recognise it now?"" The cat stared with a peculiar, piercing gaze. Its body was devoid of fur, resembling a plucked chicken. The scars crisscrossing its skin suggested it had undergone multiple surgeries. Without being told, one could hardly believe it was a creature of this planet. The shock on everyone's face wasn't merely due to its transformation, but because it had managed to survive at all. With wide eyes, bhabi asked in astonishment, ""You starved it for two months, froze it for five days, then roasted it on the stove for an hour—and it's still alive? What on earth is going on?"" ""How could it die? This is my invention!"" We were all dumbfounded. What kind of hair-raising discovery was this? The room erupted in chaos, filled with a mix of awe and uproarious chatter. The cat's photo, alongside its newfound fame, was splashed across newspapers. It even had a new name now—""Ulaika"", a blend of Ullash and Laika. Ullash had become a celebrity, and so had the cat. One day, we went to Ullash's room and asked, ""What's the big secret? Come on, tell us. We swear we won't tell anyone outside."" Ullash thought for a moment, then burst out laughing and said, ""Die? How could it die? It's already dead! I've been killing it, bit by bit, haven't I? Has Bilur ma died? You torment her much, though. Bilur baap beats him every day. Kaku, being drunk out of your mind, sometimes you…! And that day, I saw you too, baba!"" Bhabi clamped her hand over his mouth. We slipped out of the room as quietly and quickly as thieves.  ""Wait, don't you want to hear about my discovery?"" Ullash shouted after us. Translated from Bangla by Haroonuzzaman.

"V. Ramaswamy is a translator and writer based in Kolkata, India. I had first heard of him in early 2022, when a new book of translations of Shahidul Zahir was being written about in newspapers here in Bangladesh and in India. Yet it would be his work on Shahaduz Zaman where I first experienced his craft. A translator of writers such as Subimal Misra, Manoranjan Byapari, and Adhir Biswas, I found his translations to be effortless forays into the bleak world of these writers.  Speaking with Ramaswamy on behalf of The Daily Star about his life as a translator, he also shared insights on his upcoming projects and, among other things, thoughts on whether AI could ever be a serious translator.  Tell us how your journey as a translator began. My journey as a translator began almost by accident in 2005. During a casual encounter with my friend Dr Mrinal Bose, I asked him if there was one contemporary Bangla writer who he thought was worth reading; he thought for a moment, and said, ""Yes. His name is Subimal Misra."" And thus, with Dr Mrinal's prodding and pushing, I began translating Subimal Misra's short fiction. But after that initial start, I persisted with translating Misra because his writing resonated with my own background as a grassroots and community organiser and activist, working with the labouring poor of my city for two decades. I was selected for the Sangam House residency in 2011, and during the residency I was translating Misra all day, every day, one week after another. I would say that it was the Sangam House residency that made me a translator. After completing three volumes of Misra, I saw myself as a translator of voices from the margins. That was when I learnt about the autodidact writer Manoranjan Byapari, and received the novel Chandal Jibon from him. A three-month fellowship in Wales in 2016 enabled me to work on this. For me that was an apprenticeship in working on a long novel. So that's something about the journey to becoming a serious and critical translator. I was born in a Tamil-speaking family in Kolkata, and my school, college and university education were in the English medium. I learnt Bangla for three years in elementary school, so I learnt to read the language. All my reading was in or via the English language. It was through my activist engagement that I really stepped into the world of Bangla, and then became proficient not only in the language, but also in my personal engagement with  history, sociology, politics and culture of what I came to see as my land and my people. So I am an insider-outsider, or an outsider-insider, and that aspect is also ever-present in my translation endeavour. You are currently translating Prodoshe Prakrito Jon, what drew you toward the works of Shawkat Ali? It was my translation assistant, Srishti Dutta Chowdhury, who told me in 2020 about Shawkat Ali's novels, Prodoshe Prakrito Jon (The United Press Limited, 1984) and Narai (Bidyaprokash, 2012). She wanted to translate these, and asked me if I would join her. But it was the way she described these two novels that had a mantric effect on me. As it happened, Srishti was unable to devote time to this; also, following the experience of collaborative translation of Shahidul Zahir with Shahroza Nahrin, from Bangladesh, I thought I ought to induct a Bangladeshi co-translator for Shawkat Ali as well.  I had the consent from the late Shawkat Ali's family in a matter of hours. That was only because of my network and circle of friends in Bangladesh. Similarly, my eventual co-translator on the Shawkat Ali project, Mohiuddin Jahangir, was introduced to me by Asif Showkat, the author's son, now a good friend. Mohiuddin's PhD thesis was on Shawkat Ali. We completed the novel, Narai, titled as We Must Fight! in English. That will be out soon. You have been part of multiple translation projects as a co-translator. How different is the process of translating in collaboration?
 I had no plan as such to collaborate, it was just a sudden thought, and so I invited Shahroza to join me as a co-translator of the novella, ""Life and Political Reality"" (1988), by Shahidul Zahir. I had become acquainted with Shahroza Nahrin via Facebook. I arrived in Dhaka in early 2020 and sat with Shahroza for a few days; she read out, and I translated.  This first experience was a happy one, and it convinced me that when it comes to important texts, two is definitely better than one. Two people can share the ownership, responsibility and labour of translation. I would like to think that this was also a good mentorship experience for my co-translator. Bangla needs a Mukti Bahini of translators, and so this collaboration-mentorship process can also be a means towards building more translators. How do you go about choosing what to translate? Do you read the book as you go, or entirely beforehand? With all the books I translated, the decision to take it up arose through specific circumstances, situations, and people. But I had my antennae and my informants, built up through embedded experience. I do not read the book first, I read it as I am translating. No reader reads a book as closely as a translator. One goes through the text multiple times, scrutinising every word, letter and 'matra'. You once mentioned in an interview that your wife believed translating Subimal Misra made you more like Misra's writing, that is, dark. Is this something you consciously worry about? Being transformed through a work of literature? Notwithstanding the barbs of my wife and friends, I never really thought about this! But I was definitely transformed by translating Subimal Misra, not in the limited sense of becoming ""dark"", but in terms of learning and growing. Translating Manoranjan Byapari was also transformative; I became the protagonist Jibon, as it were, a boy born into the hitherto untouchable Namasudra caste, and lived through the journey of his life. Likewise with Adhir Biswas, the son of an outcaste barber, who became a writer, editor and publisher. Translating him made me his soul kin. Finally, Shahidul Zahir. Translating him was like discovering a whole new world, at one's doorstep! What do you think of machine translations in the sphere of literature? Should it ever be taken seriously?
 I guess machines will gradually get better and better, but until then we humans will carry on translating. Like literature, translation is a human act, a human choice, and the translator brings his humanity to play in his or her work. And so what we get is a creative, human, artistic work. AI can write a short story or a novel. Will it ever be as good as anything humans have ever written? I don't know. But I don't think I would be interested in reading any literary work produced by AI.  AI can generate images in a fraction of a second. But we will still look with awe at the work of the great masters. Will people stop expressing themselves in drawing and painting? Will people stop writing? So human translation will also continue, despite machines. How do you deal with cultural nuances when translating from Bangla to English? I guess one has to be embedded in the culture in order to perceive and sense the nuances. The translator must then bring this to the fore creatively. For instance, if someone addresses an older person as ""tui"" rather than ""apni"", that conveys something about sociology. About classism being ingrained in the culture. A particular word or term may be very significant, from the perspective of history, or politics, like Ponchasher Manantor, or Mir Jafar, or Dandakaranya. The translator has to be ever alert. Readers of a translated work thus also learn about the history, politics, culture etc of a people. There is something else I'd like to share in this context. When one translates, say, proverbs, there would be equivalent expressions in English. Like, ""as you sow, so you reap"". But there is an expression in Bangla, ""katth khele angra hagbe"" (if you eat wood, you'll excrete charcoal). Rather than translate that into a tame expression like ""as you sow, so you reap"", I would like to give the reader a peep into the psyche of the speakers of Bangla, the pungency of their speech etc. So I would translate the original expression itself.   Shahriar Shaams is a journalist at The Daily Star.

"Indian writer, lawyer and activist Banu Mushtaq on Tuesday won the International Booker Prize for her short story collection ""Heart Lamp"". The 77-year-old is the first author of Kannada-language literature to receive the prestigious literary award for translated fiction.  ""This moment feels like a thousand fire flies lighting a single sky -- brief, brilliant and utterly collective,"" Mushtaq said at a ceremony at the Tate Modern gallery in London. ""I accept this great honour not as an individual but as a voice raised in chorus with so many others."" Mushtaq will share the £50,000 ($67,000) prize with her translator Deepa Bhasthi, who also helped choose the stories. ""Heart Lamp"" gathers 12 stories originally published between 1990 and 2023. They portray everyday life in Muslim communities of southern India, focusing on the experiences of women and girls. Critics praised the collection for its dry and gentle humour, its witty, colloquial style and its searing commentary on patriarchy, casteism and religious conservatism. Mushtaq, based in Karnataka state, southwest India, is known for her advocacy in women's rights and her legal work confronting discrimination. The jury hailed her characters -– from spirited grandmothers to bumbling religious clerics –- as ""astonishing portraits of survival and resilience"". ""My stories are about women -– how religion, society, and politics demand unquestioning obedience from them, and in doing so, inflict inhumane cruelty upon them, turning them into mere subordinates,"" she said.

"Images of Nepal, lingering in the annals of social media and casual conversations with friends, often evoke conversations about natural beauty, spectacular architecture dotting its numerous hills, and intimate hospitality. Sandwiched between the behemoths, India and China, Nepal's history is a striking case of contradictions slaloming many structural challenges such as religious fundamentalism and ultranationalism engulfing the region today. Nepal, very much like the fictional Shangri-La, remains mired in mystery with its deeply engorged stories, myths, folklore, and its storied lived experience—from the world's only Hindu Kingdom to South Asia's most vibrant democracy—largely unknown even to its most ardent supporters. It is in the last couple of years that Nepalese literature has grown, exposing us to the multifaceted complexities in the country itself. First-time author, Smriti Ravindan weaves a tale in her novel, The Woman Who Climbed Trees, of striking clarity on the lives of the Indo-Nepal border focussing on the contested region of Madhesh, whose people have straddled along the border for the generations and have been seen as ""outsiders"" to the ruling Pahadi class in Kathmandu. Ravindan's story revolves around three women in the same family, with the first two women's destinies leading to them having respective families across the border. The story starts off with 14-year-old Meena, an Indian with a Nepali mother, Kaveri, as she is placed in an arranged marriage with the 21-year-old Manmohan, a Nepali undergraduate student and underground political activist based in India. ""Eleven hours. Another town. Another country."" This sets up the narrative for numerous entanglements, resilience, and resistance, with women's agency put front and center.  Ravindra's prose is brisk, smooth, and detailed, with numerous stories from traditional Nepali and Hindu folklore chipped in, adding layers as the story unfolds. Stories of Rama and Sita are evoked to showcase the eternal bond between the twin cities of Janakpur and Darbhanga, with Ram viewed as the groom who moved over to Janakpur to woo his bride, Sita. The first half of the book showcases the inner psychological battle Meena faces to turn up as a dutiful wife and daughter-in-law to an increasingly absent husband and an overbearing mother-in-law. Struggling with her duties as a young bride, Meena finds solace in her sister-in-law, Kumud, trespassing and bringing to the surface the volatile yet budding notions of female desire, sisterhood, and the transgressions of relationships between women. It is in the second half of the novel that the reader is drawn into the beguiling intersectional complexities and divergence of class, power, gender, and citizenship, with the focus shifting to the capital, Kathmandu, as Meena goes through multiple miscarriages that test her status as a woman in society. With Manmohan climbing up the civil service ladder, he is increasingly taunted for being Madheshi (marsiya) and ""Indian looking"". The narrator of the story later on becomes the couple's daughter, Preeti. Preeti traverses the delicate terrain of generational trauma, narrating the story in first person and acting alternatively as a cynic and a cheerleader when it comes to understanding her family's numerous problems buffeted by the changing dynamics of Nepal's political system. Preeti acts as an additional commentator to her mother's feminine rage and anguish at a system that fails women, their desires, and forms of solidarity. The matriarch of the family, Kaveri, has her story lurk in the background, providing an anchor to understanding the multifaceted and silenced lives of Madheshi women across borders. Ravindra's prose is brisk, smooth, and detailed, with numerous stories from traditional Nepali and Hindu folklore chipped in, adding layers as the story unfolds. Stories of Rama and Sita are evoked to showcase the eternal bond between the twin cities of Janakpur and Darbhanga, with Ram viewed as the groom who moved over to Janakpur to woo his bride, Sita. In the same vein, many facets of Nepali folklore are dissected, such as the story of Rani Pokhari, a large pond in Kathmandu, whose backstory lies in the tragic outcome of a royal family losing their one child. Putting female characters at the center of the story, the novel brings to life with vivid audacity what it means to be a Nepali-Indian woman in a changing subcontinent where, till today, the battles of citizenship and gender rage on. A tale of belonging, attachment, displacement—the novel unpacks and lingers on the important question: ""What is mother and motherland to a woman?""   Israr Hasan is currently working as researcher in a public health institute.

"The fruits rot on the table, a still life of my neglect. It's a familiar scene between me and my unwashed teacups. But today, I wash the fruits. It is one of those days when exhaustion outweighs hunger, when the thought of speaking to the delivery man feels like an unbearable intimacy. I come out of my room, a ghost in my own home, searching for any leftover that I might have forgotten about. Only two bananas and an apple remain in the glass bowl my mother gave me hoping that I might care for myself as much as I do for the aesthetics of this empty house. She sends me curry in ice cream tubs, fruits in shopping bags. Love in disposable containers. I take the apple to the kitchen, turn the faucet. Nothing. I twist harder, my fingers white with urgency. There is no water. I must have forgotten to fill the tank again. I am terrible at this, I whisper to no one. Back at the dining table, I sink into one of the eight chairs, too many for a woman who eats alone. The apple can't be that dirty. I rub it against my sleeve, a pathetic baptism. The first bite is crisp, then. Iron. Blood. There is blood. Whose? Mine? The apple's? My mother's? I rush to the mirror. My gums are pristine, no wound, no sin. But when I look back at the fruit, the truth reveals itself: the flesh is blackened, writhing with tiny, hungry mouths. The rot has teeth. How do I stop the disgust? The punishment of nature for suspension. For all the things I have left undone, unloved, uneaten? The very act of preservation feels like betrayal. And suddenly the room exhales winter. The floors are coated in dust, the teacups cradle curdled milk at their bottoms. And then I see her. My mother stands in the doorway, her mouth sewn shut with coarse black thread. In her hands, a new bowl of fruit, fresh, glistening, perfect. She places it on the table. The threads in her mouth loosen, drip honey. ""You let everything spoil,"" she hums, though her lips never part. The apple in my hand pulses, a second heartbeat. I press it to my ear. I hear it's weeping.

"Faria Basher, a writer from Bangladesh, has been announced as one of the five Regional Winners for this year's Commonwealth Short Story Prize. After being shortlisted for the award earlier this year for her story ""An Eye and a Leg"", Basher has become the first writer of Bangladeshi origin to win the Asian regional prize. The winning story, 'An Eye and a Leg', centres on an unmarried woman in her mid-thirties whose body begins to ""spontaneously disintegrate"". Alarmed, her parents turn to a doctor who advises them to take her to the ""Marriage Market"" in search of a cure. It is a surreal and darkly comic exploration of the trope of the ""expiring"" South Asian woman.  Basher, a 25-year-old writer drawn to the offbeat, the absurd, and the odd, said, ""Throughout time, I've seen how women across the world experience pressure and social conditioning to marry and bear children, and this is especially heightened in South Asian cultures, often dangerously so. I can't say I've been able to completely avoid it myself. Through my story, I really wanted to highlight how ridiculous it is when we say that a woman is 'past her prime', or 'losing value'. It's such an absurd way of thinking that I knew I had to use absurdism to tell this story, along with elements of the macabre, and of course, humour."" She was also appreciative of the prize itself, adding, ""I think that for many writing competitions, there's an unspoken requirement to tone down or dilute certain cultural contexts and themes. But for the Commonwealth Short Story Prize, I felt fully comfortable incorporating the South Asian thematic elements that my work required in order to be effective. These were crucial to the story I was telling and the message I was trying to get across.""  'An Eye and a Leg' juxtaposes societal expectations with those of an individual woman, delivering a massive punch from the very first lines. Quietly, without hysterics, without playing to victimhood, this satire, absurd and hilarious in turn, widens our awareness of the lack of agency for a woman, whoever she is. It is one of the best crafted stories I have read in the competition. Malaysian author Saras Manickam, who won the Asia regional prize in 2019 and served as this year's judge for the Asian region, remarked, ""However accomplished or educated (or even happy) she is, a woman is considered 'handicapped' if she is not married. On that societal premise, 'An Eye and a Leg' juxtaposes societal expectations with those of an individual woman, delivering a massive punch from the very first lines. Quietly, without hysterics, without playing to victimhood, this satire, absurd and hilarious in turn, widens our awareness of the lack of agency for a woman, whoever she is. It is one of the best crafted stories I have read in the competition."" The other regional winners are ""Mothers Not Appearing in Search"" by Joshua Lubwama from Uganda (Africa), ""Descend"" by Chanel Sutherland from Canada/Saint Vincent and the Grenadines (Canada & Europe), ""Margot's Run"" by Subraj Singh from Guyana (Caribbean), and ""Crab Sticks and Lobster Rolls"" Kathleen Ridgwell from Australia. The Chair of the Judges for this year's competition, award-winning writer and filmmaker, Professor Dr Vilsoni Hereniko, said in a congratulatory message, ""These stories illuminate many aspects of human nature and demonstrate true mastery of the short story form. Each tale shows that geography matters in storytelling. They are works of fiction that are inseparable from the local culture and history from which they have sprung. They have colour and emotional resonance—and they moved me deeply.""  The £5000 Commonwealth Short Story Prize is awarded annually by the Commonwealth Foundation for the best unpublished short story, ranging between 2,000 and 5,000 words, written by an author from a Commonwealth nation. Regional winners receive £2,500. The prize is open to anyone aged 18 or older, and entries are accepted in a wide range of languages, such as Bangla, Chinese, Creole, English, French, Greek, Malay, Maltese, Portuguese, Samoan, Swahili, Tamil, and Turkish. Submissions translated to English are also accepted. The winning stories are published online by Granta and in a special print collection by Paper+Ink. The overall winner for the Commonwealth Short Story Prize 2025 will be announced in an online ceremony on 25 June, 2025. সেনাসদর আরও জানিয়েছে, জাতীয় নিরাপত্তা বিঘ্নিত হয়, সেনাবাহিনী এমন কোনো বিষয়ে সম্পৃক্ত হবে না।",2025-05-14T10:46:38Z,fariabasherawriterfrombangladeshhasbeenannouncedasoneofthefiveregionalwinnersforthisyeariscommonwealthshortstoryprizeafterbeingshortlistedfortheawardearlierthisyearforherstoryaneyeandalegbasherhasbecomethefirstwriterofbangladeshiorigintowintheasianregionalprizethewinningstoryaneyeandalegcentresonanunmarriedwomaninhermidthirtieswhosebodybeginstospontaneouslydisintegratealarmedherparentsturntoadoctorwhoadvisesthemtotakehertothemarriagemarketinsearchofacureitisasurrealanddarklycomicetonguestickingoutlorationofthetropeoftheetonguestickingoutiringsouthasianwomanbasherayearoldwriterdrawntotheoffbeattheabsurdandtheoddsaidthroughouttimeihaveseenhowwomenacrosstheworldetonguestickingouteriencepressureandsocialconditioningtomarryandbearchildrenandthisisespeciallyheightenedinsouthasianculturesoftendangerouslysoicannotsayihavebeenabletocompletelyavoiditmyselfthroughmystoryireallywantedtohighlighthowridiculousitiswhenwesaythatawomanispastherprimeorlosingvalueitissuchanabsurdwayofthinkingthatiknewihadtouseabsurdismtotellthisstoryalongwithelementsofthemacabreandofcoursehumourshewasalsoappreciativeoftheprizeitselfaddingithinkthatformanywritingcompetitionsthereisanunspokenrequirementtotonedownordilutecertainculturalcontextsandthemesbutforthecommonwealthshortstoryprizeifeltfullycomfortableincorporatingthesouthasianthematicelementsthatmyworkrequiredinordertobeeffectivethesewerecrucialtothestoryiwastellingandthemessageiwastryingtogetacrossaneyeandalegjuxtaposessocietaletonguestickingoutectationswiththoseofanindividualwomandeliveringamassivepunchfromtheveryfirstlinesquietlywithouthystericswithoutplayingtovictimhoodthissatireabsurdandhilariousinturnwidensourawarenessofthelackofagencyforawomanwhoeversheisitisoneofthebestcraftedstoriesihavereadinthecompetitionmalaysianauthorsarasmanickamwhowontheasiaregionalprizeinandservedasthisyearisjudgefortheasianregionremarkedhoweveraccomplishedoreducatedorevenhappysheisawomanisconsideredhandicappedifsheisnotmarriedonthatsocietalpremiseaneyeandalegjuxtaposessocietaletonguestickingoutectationswiththoseofanindividualwomandeliveringamassivepunchfromtheveryfirstlinesquietlywithouthystericswithoutplayingtovictimhoodthissatireabsurdandhilariousinturnwidensourawarenessofthelackofagencyforawomanwhoeversheisitisoneofthebestcraftedstoriesihavereadinthecompetitiontheotherregionalwinnersaremothersnotappearinginsearchbyjoshualubwamafromugandaafricadescendbychanelsutherlandfromcanadasaintvincentandthegrenadinescanadaeuropemargotisrunbysubrajsinghfromguyanacaribbeanandcrabsticksandlobsterrollskathleenridgwellfromaustraliathechairofthejudgesforthisyeariscompetitionawardwinningwriterandfilmmakerprofessordrvilsoniherenikosaidinacongratulatorymessagethesestoriesilluminatemanyaspectsofhumannatureanddemonstratetruemasteryoftheshortstoryformeachtaleshowsthatgeographymattersinstorytellingtheyareworksoffictionthatareinseparablefromthelocalcultureandhistoryfromwhichtheyhavesprungtheyhavecolourandemotionalresonanceeandtheymovedmedeeplythecacommonwealthshortstoryprizeisawardedannuallybythecommonwealthfoundationforthebestunpublishedshortstoryrangingbetweenandwordswrittenbyanauthorfromacommonwealthnationregionalwinnersreceivecatheprizeisopentoanyoneagedorolderandentriesareacceptedinawiderangeoflanguagessuchasbanglachinesecreoleenglishfrenchgreekmalaymalteseportuguesesamoanswahilitamilandturkishsubmissionstranslatedtoenglisharealsoacceptedthewinningstoriesarepublishedonlinebygrantaandinaspecialprintcollectionbypaperinktheoverallwinnerforthecommonwealthshortstoryprizewillbeannouncedinanonlineceremonyonjuneeabeaeaaeabeeabeaaeabeaeabeaeaceabeeaaeabfeafeaeabeaeaceabeeaaeaeafeaaeabfeabeabeeaaaeaaealaughingeaaeabeeaaceabfeaealaughingeaaeabfeaaeabeafeabeaeaaeabeeaaceabeeabeabfeaaeaeafeaaeeaaeaeabeaaeabeaaceabfeabeafeaeabeaaeealaughingeaaaeaeaealaughingeaaeabeaaceaeaaeabeeaa
"As the sun set amidst the ongoing heatwave of Dhaka, enthusiastic writers and storytellers gathered at the Goethe-Institut in Dhanmondi. Their purpose was to enjoy an evening of stories and writings curated by Sehri Tales. Sister Library, in collaboration with Sehri Tales, hosted a writing prompt on two significant themes: 'Pink' and 'Digital'. A multitude of writings from all over Bangladesh, as well as some from Pakistan, poured in. And so, the event commenced with a promise of memorable tales about memory, femininity, modernity, identity, and more. The evening began with a speech by Katerina Don, the co-founder and creative director of CholPori. She warmly welcomed everyone to the event while also introducing its premise to the audience. Afterwards, Sabrina Fatma Ahmed, the creator of Sehri Tales, was called on stage to talk about her project. Sabrina told the audience how this year's Sehri Tales was a bit different from previous years, as they moved away from Talespeople, a Facebook group where writers would typically post their works, to a more public forum as a result of the overwhelming response they got from enthusiastic writers. She drew out the 10 years she spent on this project, and later moved on to read two pieces she wrote from the prompts, 'Pink' and 'Digital'. The moderator for the evening, Zaima Hamid Zoa, called several writers on stage, each of whom then presented their writings on the prompts. The writers' pieces captured the nuances of being a female online at this time and age, while also exploring other facets of femininity, such as women's difficult relationship with the colour pink and girlhood. They explored the dangers that women face online, as well as the ideological differences an individual feels from being chronically online.  After the Bangladeshi writers were done reading their stories aloud, the Pakistani writers were connected via Google Meet to read their stories and poems. The first writer, Umar Ahmad, recited a poem on the prompt, 'Pink', while the second, Zara Asad, recited a poem dedicated to her best friend. Ammara Naeem, the third and final poet, read out her poem about the dichotomies of masculinity and femininity.  The evening closed with a zine-making workshop, with the prompt ""A Safe Space"". Sabrina Fatma Ahmad commented that, ever since they had gone more public with Talespeople, female participants showed more reservations because they didn't feel safe enough to share their pieces on a public forum online. This sentiment was what prompted the subject matter of the zine-making workshop. The participants were given 10 minutes to elaborate on whatever a safe space meant to them, and the writings were stored to collectively be made into a zine that would be available at Sister Library's next event. After the zine workshop, the evening drew to a close with delectable treats and coffee, while the audience members engaged in lively conversation. The event left everyone with a full heart and a personal objective: to write more, and to write more freely.

"Environment Adviser Syeda Rizwana Hasan today said that the Sal trees and its biodiversity will be brought back to the Sal forest. ""The forest dwellers here should play their role in protecting this forest. Students are being involved in these activities. Boundary pillars are being provided to identify the encroached areas in the forest,"" Rizwana said while planting Sal seedlings in the Telki area of ​​Madhupur under the jurisdiction of the Tangail Forest Department in the afternoon. Therefore, more and more Sal trees should be planted in the upcoming monsoon, she said. She also said that eucalyptus and acacia trees are commercially planted in the Sal forest. These will be phased out. In response to a question from journalists, the adviser said that although it is not possible to do it now, the encroached forest land of Madhupur will be recovered in phases. Later, the activities of the ""Madhupur Shalban Restoration through the Participation of Local Communities"" project were inaugurated by inspecting the boundary marking work and installing boundary pillars in the Rajabari area of ​​the Madhupur forest area. She addressed as the chief guest at a discussion meeting marking the International Day for Biological Diversity 2025 in Dokhala, Madhupur. She called on local forest dwellers to be vigilant in protecting the forest. She told them that if they are in the forest, they should behave like the forest. She said that hundreds of acres of forest land should be cleared of pineapple and banana cultivation and trees compatible with the Sal forest should be planted. At this time, the advisor announced the withdrawal of 129 cases filed against forest dwellers, including ethnic minorities, in Madhupur.

"  A Liberian cargo ship carrying 640 containers, including 13 classified as containing hazardous materials, has sunk in the Arabian Sea off the coast of the Indian state of Kerala. The incident has raised concerns about a potential oil spill in a region known for its rich biodiversity, officials said today. ""In the early hours of today (May 25), MSC ELSA 3 listed rapidly and capsized at position 09°18.76'N 076°08.12'E and sank,"" an Indian Coast Guard statement today said. The 184-metre-long vessel's 24-member crew comprises one Russian, 20 Filipinos, two Ukrainians and one Georgian national. The ICG said its ship ""Saksham,"" equipped with pollution response equipment, has been positioned at the scene to respond to any oil spill scenario. Of the 640 containers onboard, 13 contained hazardous cargo while 12 containers had calcium carbide, said the statement. ""The ship had in its tanks 84.44 tonnes of diesel and 367.1 tonnes of furnace oil,"" the ICG said. Noting that the sensitive coast of Kerala is home to both vivid biodiversity and is a major tourist attraction, the statement said the ICG has geared up pollution response preparedness in coordination with the state administration for all possible scenarios. ""ICG aircraft with advanced oil spill mapping technology are undertaking an assessment of the situation. Presently, no oil spill has been reported,"" it added. The Indian Navy and the Coast Guard were exploring methods to assist in towing the vessel. The Liberian container ship, carrying marine fuel, tilted several degrees about 38 nautical miles off the Kerala coast on Saturday, causing its cargo to spill into the sea. An Indian defence ministry public relations officer said another vessel from the parent company had reached the area as part of the assistance efforts. Authorities said all 24 crew members on board the vessel have been rescued. The Kerala State Disaster Management Authority (KSDMA) has cautioned the general public against touching any cargo containers or oil spills that may wash ashore. সেনাসদর আরও জানিয়েছে, জাতীয় নিরাপত্তা বিঘ্নিত হয়, সেনাবাহিনী এমন কোনো বিষয়ে সম্পৃক্ত হবে না।",2025-05-25T11:13:55Z,caaliberiancargoshipcarryingcontainersincludingclassifiedascontaininghazardousmaterialshassunkinthearabianseaoffthecoastoftheindianstateofkeralatheincidenthasraisedconcernsaboutapotentialoilspillinaregionknownforitsrichbiodiversityofficialssaidtodayintheearlyhoursoftodaymaymscelsalistedrapidlyandcapsizedatpositioncbncbeandsankanindiancoastguardstatementtodaysaidthemetrelongvesselismembercrewcomprisesonerussianfilipinostwoukrainiansandonegeorgiannationaltheicgsaiditsshipsakshamequippedwithpollutionresponseequipmenthasbeenpositionedatthescenetorespondtoanyoilspillscenarioofthecontainersonboardcontainedhazardouscargowhilecontainershadcalciumcarbidesaidthestatementtheshiphadinitstankstonnesofdieselandtonnesoffurnaceoiltheicgsaidnotingthatthesensitivecoastofkeralaishometobothvividbiodiversityandisamajortouristattractionthestatementsaidtheicghasgeareduppollutionresponsepreparednessincoordinationwiththestateadministrationforallpossiblescenariosicgaircraftwithadvancedoilspillmappingtechnologyareundertakinganassessmentofthesituationpresentlynooilspillhasbeenreporteditaddedtheindiannavyandthecoastguardwereetonguestickingoutloringmethodstoassistintowingthevesseltheliberiancontainershipcarryingmarinefueltiltedseveraldegreesaboutnauticalmilesoffthekeralacoastonsaturdaycausingitscargotospillintotheseaanindiandefenceministrypublicrelationsofficersaidanothervesselfromtheparentcompanyhadreachedtheareaaspartoftheassistanceeffortsauthoritiessaidallcrewmembersonboardthevesselhavebeenrescuedthekeralastatedisastermanagementauthorityksdmahascautionedthegeneralpublicagainsttouchinganycargocontainersoroilspillsthatmaywashashoreeabeaeaaeabeeabeaaeabeaeabeaeaceabeeaaeabfeafeaeabeaeaceabeeaaeaeafeaaeabfeabeabeeaaaeaaealaughingeaaeabeeaaceabfeaealaughingeaaeabfeaaeabeafeabeaeaaeabeeaaceabeeabeabfeaaeaeafeaaeeaaeaeabeaaeabeaaceabfeabeafeaeabeaaeealaughingeaaaeaeaealaughingeaaeabeaaceaeaaeabeeaa
"Ainul Haque, 70, a retired primary school teacher in Sayedpur village under Shahzadpur upazila of Sirajganj, lost his house to Jamuna river's erosion five times in last 30 years. On last Wednesday, the river devoured his house yet again, for the sixth time. ""A crack appeared in the riverbank near the house all of a sudden on Wednesday noon, and by the evening, everything was gone. My family members and I only managed to save our lives, nothing else,"" Ainul added. ""At least five houses were devoured by Jamuna while some 10-15 houses were relocated from riverbank, including mine, in last couple of weeks,"" said Md Niam Uddin Bepari, a resident of the village. ""When I built my house four years ago, the river was at least 500 metres away. Now it has moved close to my doorstep,"" he added. Not only Sayedpur village, but also at least 5-6 spots in neighbouring Koijuri Bazar, Haatpachil, Dhitpur and Kurshi villages in the upazila have become vulnerable to river erosion. Sonatoni union in the upazila has been the worst affected in the recent spell of Jamuna's erosion. Md Kamruzzaman, Shahzadpur upazila nirbahi officer, said they would begin relief work if necessary. Md Najmul Hossain, sub-divisional engineer of Bangladesh Water Development Board in Sirajganj, said a Tk 651 crore project to develop 8-km flood protection embankment and 6.5-km riverbank protection is undergoing from Enayetpur to Haatpachil area of Shahzadpur upazila to mitigate river erosion. ""Upon completion of the project, likely by 2026, entire Shahzadpur upazila will be protected from Jamuna's erosion,"" he added. Contacted, Md Mokhlesur Rahman, executive engineer of BWDB in Sirajganj, said most of the erosion hit areas of Sonatoni union are remote shoal lands that are located beyond the riverbank protection work. ""As the river is swelling up, riverbank areas along the shoals have been eroding, which is natural. However, there is no damage in the protected areas along the riverbank,"" he added. সেনাসদর আরও জানিয়েছে, জাতীয় নিরাপত্তা বিঘ্নিত হয়, সেনাবাহিনী এমন কোনো বিষয়ে সম্পৃক্ত হবে না।",2025-05-24T20:00:00Z,ainulhaquearetiredprimaryschoolteacherinsayedpurvillageundershahzadpurupazilaofsirajganjlosthishousetojamunariveriserosionfivetimesinlastyearsonlastwednesdaytheriverdevouredhishouseyetagainforthesixthtimeacrackappearedintheriverbanknearthehouseallofasuddenonwednesdaynoonandbytheeveningeverythingwasgonemyfamilymembersandionlymanagedtosaveourlivesnothingelseainuladdedatleastfivehousesweredevouredbyjamunawhilesomehouseswererelocatedfromriverbankincludingmineinlastcoupleofweekssaidmdniamuddinbepariaresidentofthevillagewhenibuiltmyhousefouryearsagotheriverwasatleastmetresawaynowithasmovedclosetomydoorstepheaddednotonlysayedpurvillagebutalsoatleastspotsinneighbouringkoijuribazarhaatpachildhitpurandkurshivillagesintheupazilahavebecomevulnerabletorivererosionsonatoniunionintheupazilahasbeentheworstaffectedintherecentspellofjamunaiserosionmdkamruzzamanshahzadpurupazilanirbahiofficersaidtheywouldbeginreliefworkifnecessarymdnajmulhossainsubdivisionalengineerofbangladeshwaterdevelopmentboardinsirajganjsaidatkcroreprojecttodevelopkmfloodprotectionembankmentandkmriverbankprotectionisundergoingfromenayetpurtohaatpachilareaofshahzadpurupazilatomitigaterivererosionuponcompletionoftheprojectlikelybyentireshahzadpurupazilawillbeprotectedfromjamunaiserosionheaddedcontactedmdmokhlesurrahmanexecutiveengineerofbwdbinsirajganjsaidmostoftheerosionhitareasofsonatoniunionareremoteshoallandsthatarelocatedbeyondtheriverbankprotectionworkastheriverisswellingupriverbankareasalongtheshoalshavebeenerodingwhichisnaturalhoweverthereisnodamageintheprotectedareasalongtheriverbankheaddedeabeaeaaeabeeabeaaeabeaeabeaeaceabeeaaeabfeafeaeabeaeaceabeeaaeaeafeaaeabfeabeabeeaaaeaaealaughingeaaeabeeaaceabfeaealaughingeaaeabfeaaeabeafeabeaeaaeabeeaaceabeeabeabfeaaeaeafeaaeeaaeaeabeaaeabeaaceabfeabeafeaeabeaaeealaughingeaaaeaeaealaughingeaaeabeaaceaeaaeabeeaa
"  Residents along the banks of the Netai river in Mymensingh's Dhobaura upazila have expressed concern over possible flooding during the monsoon and demanded the construction of a permanent river protection embankment. In the absence of a permanent embankment, upstream water from the Meghalaya hills across the border swells the river every monsoon and inundates vast stretches of land along the riverbank, causing extensive damage to crops, fisheries, and infrastructure, they said. Around 40,000 people live in different villages on the riverside in the upazila. Over the years, many families have been displaced from their lands and had to take shelter in different areas of the upazila and elsewhere, facing flooding, erosion, and loss of livelihoods, they added. An embankment was built on the river some 25 years ago on a temporary basis but was damaged at different spots over the years, leaving residents of adjacent villages vulnerable to flooding and erosion during the monsoon, said Adil Ahmed, a farmer of Bhuiyanpara village. ""Construction of a sustainable embankment would have resolved the issue, but our longstanding demand keeps getting ignored,"" he added. Beauty Akter of the same area echoed the concern. ""Last year, some 30 villages were affected by flood during the monsoon following heavy rainfall and onrush of upstream water from India's Meghalaya, causing extensive damage to Aman paddy, vegetable plantations, and fish farms, while snapping electricity and mobile network for several days,"" said Abul Hashem, a local journalist. The problem has continued for decades due to the utter negligence of Bangladesh Water Development Board officials, he alleged. ""The river has devoured my home twice, leaving me destitute. I am now living at a relative's house with nothing else left,"" said Hasu Mia, 65, of Jigatola village. Locals said politicians had pledged the construction of a permanent embankment time and again before every national and local election, but none ever kept the promises. ""Late Dr Mohammad Ali, a former lawmaker during BNP's tenure, initiated construction of a 15-kilometre river protection embankment from Bhuiyanpara to Kalsindur Bazar in 1992. However, the project was not completed later on, and the temporary structure got severely damaged over the years to be rendered useless,"" said Shahjahan Miah, a member of Ghoshgoan union parishad. ""Even if the broken parts of the embankment were repaired every year, the loss to property and agriculture could have been minimised,"" he added. Farid Al Razi Komol, former chairman of Ghoshgoan union parishad, said a sustainable and permanent embankment on the river is needed to protect the local people. ""Aman crop on 16,090 hectares of land in the district, including 10,560 hectares in Dhobaura upazila, was damaged during the flood in the monsoon last year,"" said Nasrin Akter Banu, deputy director of the Department of Agricultural Extension in Mymensingh. ""Fish from some 10,800 enclosures, mostly in Dhobaura and Haluaghat upazilas, were washed away and 6,875 fish farmers faced a total loss of over Tk 50 crore in last year's flood,"" said Mohammad Nazim Uddin, district fisheries officer. Nishat Sharmin, upazila nirbahi officer in Dhobaura, said proposals were made at development and coordination meetings at district and upazila levels on several occasions for a sustainable embankment on the Netai river, but no steps have been taken to this end yet. Denying the allegations of negligence, Akhlaq Ul Jamil, executive engineer of BWDB in Mymensingh, said a feasibility study for a permanent embankment is going on and a Development Project Proposal (DPP) will be submitted to the concerned ministry once the study is completed. ""If the proposal is approved, we would begin work for constructing the embankment,"" he added. সেনাসদর আরও জানিয়েছে, জাতীয় নিরাপত্তা বিঘ্নিত হয়, সেনাবাহিনী এমন কোনো বিষয়ে সম্পৃক্ত হবে না।",2025-05-24T13:22:29Z,caresidentsalongthebanksofthenetairiverinmymensinghisdhobauraupazilahaveetonguestickingoutressedconcernoverpossiblefloodingduringthemonsoonanddemandedtheconstructionofapermanentriverprotectionembankmentintheabsenceofapermanentembankmentupstreamwaterfromthemeghalayahillsacrosstheborderswellstherivereverymonsoonandinundatesvaststretchesoflandalongtheriverbankcausingextensivedamagetocropsfisheriesandinfrastructuretheysaidaroundpeopleliveindifferentvillagesontheriversideintheupazilaovertheyearsmanyfamilieshavebeendisplacedfromtheirlandsandhadtotakeshelterindifferentareasoftheupazilaandelsewherefacingfloodingerosionandlossoflivelihoodstheyaddedanembankmentwasbuiltontheriversomeyearsagoonatemporarybasisbutwasdamagedatdifferentspotsovertheyearsleavingresidentsofadjacentvillagesvulnerabletofloodinganderosionduringthemonsoonsaidadilahmedafarmerofbhuiyanparavillageconstructionofasustainableembankmentwouldhaveresolvedtheissuebutourlongstandingdemandkeepsgettingignoredheaddedbeautyakterofthesameareaechoedtheconcernlastyearsomevillageswereaffectedbyfloodduringthemonsoonfollowingheavyrainfallandonrushofupstreamwaterfromindiaismeghalayacausingextensivedamagetoamanpaddyvegetableplantationsandfishfarmswhilesnappingelectricityandmobilenetworkforseveraldayssaidabulhashemalocaljournalisttheproblemhascontinuedfordecadesduetotheutternegligenceofbangladeshwaterdevelopmentboardofficialsheallegedtheriverhasdevouredmyhometwiceleavingmedestituteiamnowlivingatarelativeishousewithnothingelseleftsaidhasumiaofjigatolavillagelocalssaidpoliticianshadpledgedtheconstructionofapermanentembankmenttimeandagainbeforeeverynationalandlocalelectionbutnoneeverkeptthepromiseslatedrmohammadaliaformerlawmakerduringbnpistenureinitiatedconstructionofakilometreriverprotectionembankmentfrombhuiyanparatokalsindurbazarinhowevertheprojectwasnotcompletedlateronandthetemporarystructuregotseverelydamagedovertheyearstoberendereduselesssaidshahjahanmiahamemberofghoshgoanunionparishadevenifthebrokenpartsoftheembankmentwererepairedeveryyearthelosstopropertyandagriculturecouldhavebeenminimisedheaddedfaridalrazikomolformerchairmanofghoshgoanunionparishadsaidasustainableandpermanentembankmentontheriverisneededtoprotectthelocalpeopleamancroponhectaresoflandinthedistrictincludinghectaresindhobauraupazilawasdamagedduringthefloodinthemonsoonlastyearsaidnasrinakterbanudeputydirectorofthedepartmentofagriculturalextensioninmymensinghfishfromsomeenclosuresmostlyindhobauraandhaluaghatupazilaswerewashedawayandfishfarmersfacedatotallossofovertkcroreinlastyearisfloodsaidmohammadnazimuddindistrictfisheriesofficernishatsharminupazilanirbahiofficerindhobaurasaidproposalsweremadeatdevelopmentandcoordinationmeetingsatdistrictandupazilalevelsonseveraloccasionsforasustainableembankmentonthenetairiverbutnostepshavebeentakentothisendyetdenyingtheallegationsofnegligenceakhlaquljamilexecutiveengineerofbwdbinmymensinghsaidafeasibilitystudyforapermanentembankmentisgoingonandadevelopmentprojectproposaldppwillbesubmittedtotheconcernedministryoncethestudyiscompletediftheproposalisapprovedwewouldbeginworkforconstructingtheembankmentheaddedeabeaeaaeabeeabeaaeabeaeabeaeaceabeeaaeabfeafeaeabeaeaceabeeaaeaeafeaaeabfeabeabeeaaaeaaealaughingeaaeabeeaaceabfeaealaughingeaaeabfeaaeabeafeabeaeaaeabeeaaceabeeabeabfeaaeaeafeaaeeaaeaeabeaaeabeaaceabfeabeafeaeabeaaeealaughingeaaaeaeaealaughingeaaeabeaaceaeaaeabeeaa
